This repository shows how to transform text files to a spreadsheet format. 
You can use the file [transform_texts_to_corpus.R](transform_texts_to_corpus.R) as a template. 
Just upload your text data into the folder [raw_data](raw_data). 
The csv-file will be saved in the folder [output](output).

If you have any questions or problems, either create an Issue or get in contact with me: mullers@tcd.ie
