STONG LEADERSHIP
A CLEAR ECONOMIC PLAN
A BRIGHTER, MORE SECURE FUTURE


We have a plan for every stage of your life:
- FOR THE BEST START IN LIFE
we will continue to increase spending on the NHS, provide 7-day a week access to your GP
and deliver a truly 7-day NHS – so you know you will always have access to a free and high quality
health service when you need it most.
- FOR YOUR SCHOOL YEARS
we will maintain the amount of money that follows each child into school, ensure there is a good
primary school place available for every child and lift the cap on university places – so you have the
skills you need to succeed.
- TO SECURE YOUR FIRST JOB
we will create 3 million new apprenticeships; take everyone earning less than £12,500 out of Income
Tax altogether and pass a law to ensure we have a Tax-Free Minimum Wage in this country; and
continue to create a fairer welfare system where benefits are capped to the level that makes work pay
– so you are rewarded for working hard and doing the right thing.
- AS YOU RAISE YOUR FAMILY
we will extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants, build 200,000 new Starter Homes
– 20 per cent below the market price, for first-time buyers under 40 – and provide 30 hours of free
childcare to working parents of three and four year-olds – so you are able to work while having the
security of your own home in which to raise your family.
- WHILE YOU GROW OLDER
we will not raise VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax but we will raise the 40p
Income Tax threshold to £50,000 and take the family home out of tax by increasing the effective
Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million – so you can keep
more of your income and pass it on to future generations.
- AND WHEN YOU RETIRE
we will continue to increase the Basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent through the triple lock,
give you the freedom to use your pension savings as you want and pass them on tax-free and we
will cap the amount you can be charged for your residential care – so you can have the dignity and
security you deserve in your old age.
The next Conservative Government will secure a better
future for you, your family and Britain.


Foreword
Over the last five years, we have put our country back on the right track. Five years ago, Britain was on the brink. As the
outgoing Labour Treasury Minister put it with brutal candour, ‘there is no money’. Since then, we have turned things around.
Britain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. We are getting our national finances back under
control. We have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. More people are in work than ever before. Britain is back on
its feet, strong and growing stronger every day.
This has not happened by accident. It is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long-term
economic plan. Above all, it is the product of a supreme national effort, in which everyone has made sacrifices and everyone
has played their part.
It is a profound Conservative belief that our country is made great not through the action of government alone, but
through the flair, the ingenuity and hard work of the British people – and so it has proved the last five years.
We can be proud of what we have achieved so far together, and especially proud that as we have taken hard decisions on
public spending, we have protected the National Health Service, with 9,500 more doctors and 6,900 more nurses, and
ensured generous rises in the State Pension.
Our friends and competitors overseas look at Britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country
on the rise. They see a country that believes in itself. But our national recovery remains a work in progress. It is fragile, and
with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversed.
So the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for
our country depend? And how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives?
This Manifesto sets out our plan to do just that. It is a plan for a better future – for you, for your family. It is a plan for
every stage of your life. For your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care. For your child, there will be a
place at an excellent school. As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career
for you with a decent income. As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help. As you
raise your family, we will help you with childcare. And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement.
Throughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished
National Health Service to give you the care you need.
And in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, we will fulfil the most basic duty of government – to defend our
country and keep it safe.
But all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy. So as you consider how to vote, I hope you will ask this:
which party is best placed to keep our economy strong? The team which has delivered the growing economy we have today,
which created more jobs since 2010 than the rest of the European Union put together; or the party which left behind a
ruined economy just five short years ago?
Now is a time to build on the progress we have made, not to put it all at risk. This Manifesto is our plan of action – our plan
to take our amazing country forward. Above all, it is a plan for you.
I hope you will give it your support, so that together, we can see through the task we have begun.


- AN ECONOMIC PLAN TO HELP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
A strong economy to help you and your family
Our commitment to you:
Your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital,
your pension – all these things depend on a strong economy. So we will carry on working
through our long-term economic plan. We will:
- keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts
- increase the tax-free Personal Allowance to £12,500 and the 40p Income Tax threshold to £50,000
- commit to no increases in VAT, National Insurance contributions or Income Tax
- crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most do
- rebalance our economy, build a Northern Powerhouse and back elected metro mayors
- pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.

The fastest growing of all the
major advanced economies
in 2014
1,000 jobs created for every day
of the Parliament since 2010
We have halved the deficit as a
share of our economy
A strong economy allows us
to invest in and protect our
public services like the NHS
and schools

Our long-term economic plan is turning around Britain’s
economy. Five years ago, Britain was reeling from the
chaos of Labour’s Great Recession; in 2014 we were the
fastest growing of all the major advanced economies –
last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than Germany, three
times faster than the Eurozone and seven times faster
than France. Five years ago, the budget deficit was more
than 10 per cent of GDP, the highest in our peacetime
history, and the national debt was rising out of control;
today, the deficit is half that level and debt as a share of
national income will start falling this financial year.
Industries are coming back to life. Companies are striding
into new markets. Manufacturers are returning to our
shores. More tech companies are starting up here than
anywhere else in Europe. We have overtaken France as the
third largest car producer in Europe and there are 760,000
more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating
wealth across the country.
The Great Recession has given way to a Great Revival,
which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day:
more than the rest of the European Union combined.
This is no accident. It is the product of hard work by
people in every part of the country and it is thanks to
the success of our long-term economic plan. By halving
the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the
economy. By maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped
keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be.
And by establishing the independent Office for Budget
Responsibility (OBR), we have ended – permanently – the
ability of politicians to cook the books for political gain
at the nation’s expense. With inflation at a record low, the
latest OBR forecasts show that living standards will be
higher in 2015 than in 2010, and are set to grow strongly
every year for the rest of the decade, with the average
family £900 better off. It is only by securing the recovery,
dealing with our debts and creating jobs that we can
continue to raise living standards. That means sticking to
our long-term economic plan; Britain is on the right path.
But the job is not finished. There are clouds on the
international horizon. Huge challenges remain at home.
We have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per
cent of GDP, but that is still too high. Our trade with
emerging economies is up, with exports to China more
than doubled since 2009, but overall we are still too


dependent on slow-growing European markets. Business
investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared
to other countries. Productivity remains too low. And
while prosperity is now spreading around the country,
our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on
financial services.
We will finish the job we started in a balanced way. Those
with the broadest shoulders have contributed the most
to deficit reduction – which is why inequality has fallen,
and child and pensioner poverty are down – and they will
continue to do so. We will increase NHS spending every
year. We will control spending, eliminate the deficit, and
start to run a surplus. We will go from stuck in the red, to
back in the black. By building on the foundations we have
put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be
able to pursue our ambition for Britain to become the most
prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.
If we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we
will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made
in the last five years. More borrowing – and the extra
debt interest that it brings – means there is less money
to spend on schools and hospitals. More spending
means higher taxes for hardworking people, and interest
rates that are higher than they otherwise would be –
punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobs.
And failing to control our debt would be more than an
economic failing; it would be a moral failing – leaving
our children and grandchildren with debts that they
could never hope to repay.
So you face a clear choice. Economic competence, with
David Cameron as Prime Minister, following through
on our long-term economic plan. Or economic chaos
under Labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan
to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more
secure economy.
Our plan of action:
We will finish the job by eliminating the deficit
to keep our economy secure and keep your
taxes and mortgage payments down
Our long-term economic plan reflects our values: we as a
nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable
levels of debt to the next generation. We will eliminate the
deficit in a sensible and balanced way that will enable us to
continue to increase spending on the NHS and cut Income
Tax for 30 million working people.
Our deficit reduction plan has two phases. The first
will see us continue to reduce government spending by
one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full
financial years of the next Parliament, the same rate as
over the last five years. That means saving £1 a year
in every £100 that government spends. We don’t think
there’s a business that couldn’t do that – and we don’t
think government, when it is spending your money,
should be any different.
That will require a further £30 billion in fiscal
consolidation over the next two years, on top of the
£120 billion that we have already identified and
delivered over this Parliament. We will find £13 billion
from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction
as in this Parliament. We will find £12 billion from
welfare savings, on top of the £21 billion of savings
delivered in this Parliament. And we will raise at least
£5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and
aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning, building
on the £7 billion of annual savings we have delivered
in this Parliament. This £30 billion of further
consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps
falling as a share of GDP and to deliver a balanced


structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new
fiscal mandate that Parliament voted on earlier this year.
Our commitment goes further than this. A balanced
current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable
reduction in our level of national debt, which remains
far too high in a world of continuing economic
challenges. International evidence and Treasury analysis
shows that the only way to keep our economy secure
for the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start
running a surplus. Anything less would be to ignore the
lessons of the past.
That is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction
plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus,
with the Government taking in more than it is spending for
the first time in 18 years. That means we can start properly
paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual
interest payments – reducing the UK’s vulnerability to
future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining.
We will achieve this by continuing to control government
spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but
instead growing it in line with inflation.
From 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved,
spending will grow in line with GDP. A new fundamental
principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent
OBR, will ensure that in normal economic times, when
the economy is growing, the government will always run
a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep
our economy secure, with a state neither smaller than we
need nor bigger than we can afford. Total government
spending as a share of our national income at the end of
the next Parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher
than in the year 2000, the year before Labour lost all
control of spending and the national debt started its
longest rise for hundreds of years.
Our approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending,
making savings in welfare, and continuing to crack down
on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance. This means that
we can commit to no increases in VAT, Income Tax or
National Insurance. Tax rises on working people would
harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost
jobs. Instead, as we reduce the deficit, we will cut Income
Tax, as we have done over the last five years: during the
next Parliament, we will increase the tax-free Personal
Allowance to £12,500 and the higher rate threshold to
£50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned money.
We will continue to build a stronger, safer and
more secure banking system that serves its
customers and provides businesses with the
finance they need to grow and create jobs
We will make sure our financial services industry is the
best regulated in the world with our new system of
supervision led by the independent Bank of England.
Our new Financial Policy Committee will monitor and
control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across
the whole economy – a vital task that was totally ignored
in the run up to the financial crisis. Our tough new
Financial Conduct Authority will protect consumers and
ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the
whole economy. To protect hardworking taxpayers from
future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring-fencing
banks’ high street branches from their investment
arms by 2019 at the latest. In order to ensure that new
pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short-termism,
we will ensure that Britain continues to have the
toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any
financial centre. We will continue to sell the Government’s
stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societies
in order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and
support the economy. Hardworking taxpayers supported
the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks
should in turn support them during the recovery – that
is why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict
established banks’ ability to pay less tax by offsetting their
profits against past losses.

The richest are paying a greater
share of income tax than in any
of Labour’s 13 years

To eliminate the deficit we
must continue to cut out
wasteful spending and make
government more efficient,
effective and accountable


We will make the banks work for you
Our plan is to ensure banks help secure our recovery
and back businesses to create jobs and growth in our
economy. We capped payday lenders, made it easier
for you to switch your bank account and will continue
to support the credit union movement in making
financial services more accessible. We will continue the
successful Funding for Lending scheme into 2016. We
will help new and existing challenger banks to inject
fresh competition into the market for personal current
accounts, mortgages and business loans, including
through the British Business Bank, while backing the
financial technology revolution. We will improve our
support for investment into start-ups and roll-out our
innovative Help to Grow scheme, which will plug a £1
billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand,
invest and take on new employees.
We will continue to lead the world on tax and
transparency
Tackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and
tax planning is an important part of our long-term
economic plan. We will increase the annual tax charges
paid by those with non-domiciled status, ensuring that
they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit,
and continue to tackle abuses of this status. We will
lead international efforts to ensure global companies
pay their fair share in tax, as David Cameron did at
the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013, which
secured significant international progress on fairer
tax rules and full transparency over who really owns
companies. We will push for all countries to sign up
to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;
review the implementation of the new international
country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the
case for making this information publicly available on a
multilateral basis. We will ensure developing countries
have full access to global automatic tax information
exchange systems and continue to build the capacity
of tax authorities in developing countries. We are also
making it a crime if companies fail to put in place
measures to stop economic crime, such as tax evasion, in
their organisations and making sure that the penalties are
large enough to punish and deter.
We will rebalance our economy and build a
Northern Powerhouse
We are committed to a truly national recovery, benefiting all
parts of our country. We have devolved powers to Scotland
and Wales, and set out long-term economic plans to raise
the growth rate of all parts of England, bringing areas which
have grown more slowly up to at least the national average.
Over the last year, the North grew faster than the South. By
connecting up the North with modern transport links, we
will enable its great cities and towns to pool their strengths.
We will invest a record £13 billion in transport for the North.
We will electrify the main rail routes, build the Northern
Hub, and provide new trains for the North. We will upgrade
the A1, M62, M1 and A555 link road. And that is on top of
our £50 billion commitment to build High Speed 2 – the
new North-South railway linking up London with the West
Midlands, Leeds and Manchester – and develop High Speed
3 to join up the North. We will back scientific and technical
strengths by creating new institutions such as Health North;
the Royce Institute for Advanced Materials in Manchester,
Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield; the National Centre for
Ageing Science and Innovation in Newcastle; the Cognitive
Computing centre at Daresbury; and by making investments
in energy research in Blackpool, Cumbria and Thornton.
We will back new jobs in the South West
To help attract growth and new businesses we will
improve connections to the South West with major
investment in the M5, A358, A30 and A303, and
the electrification of the Great Western Main Line –
bringing new fast trains on the route. We will invest to
boost tourism in the South West and ensure the world-class
defence assets and cyber-security industries of the
South West benefit the local economy.

We are fixing the economy
so that everyone feels the
benefit

Britain's exports are growing
fastest in the North East and
our employment fastest in the
North West


We will make the Midlands an engine of growth
We will back business by investing a record £5.2 billion
in better transport, upgrading the M1 and M6, and
electrifying the Midland Main Line from St Pancras
to Sheffield – putting the Midlands at the centre of
a modern, inter-connected transport network for the
UK. We will back the Midlands’ strength in advanced
manufacturing, engineering and science with major
projects such as the Energy Research Accelerator and
support for innovation in the motor industry.
We will properly connect the East of England
and back innovation
We will improve rail connections to East Anglia,
delivering ‘Norwich in 90 minutes’ and ‘Ipswich in 60
minutes’ and upgrade key roads like the A11 and A47.
We will support the creation of new jobs by backing the
East’s great strengths – agri-tech, high-tech businesses
around Cambridge, and energy businesses at Great
Yarmouth and Lowestoft.
We will devolve powers and budgets to boost
local growth in England
We will devolve far-reaching powers over economic
development, transport and social care to large cities which
choose to have elected mayors. We will legislate to deliver
the historic deal for Greater Manchester, which will devolve
powers and budgets and lead to the creation of a directly
elected Mayor for Greater Manchester. In Cambridgeshire,
Greater Manchester and Cheshire East, we will pilot
allowing local councils to retain 100 per cent of growth
in business rates, so they reap the benefit of decisions that
boost growth locally. We will devolve further powers over
skills spending and planning to the Mayor of London.
And we will deliver more bespoke Growth Deals with
local councils, where locally supported, and back Local
Enterprise Partnerships to promote jobs and growth.

We support policies that grow
the economy as a whole,
generating new jobs and
higher wages for everybody


Better roads, trains and modern communications
Our commitment to you:
You depend on infrastructure at every stage of your life: to go to school, to go to work, to enable
businesses to grow and create jobs for your children and grandchildren. We have a plan of
action that will improve our roads, railways, airports and internet connections. We will:
- invest in infrastructure to attract businesses and good jobs across the whole of the UK
- make your life easier, with more and faster trains, more roads and cycle routes
- keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament
- roll out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is part of the digital economy.

Under Labour, road and rail were starved of resources,
while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the
digital divide. This meant packed trains, potholes, patchy
broadband coverage – businesses held back and cities left
behind. Turning these problems around takes time.
But because we have made savings elsewhere, we
have been able to make significant investments in
infrastructure. We will commit, alongside running a
surplus, to increase our capital spending – investment in
infrastructure – at least in line with our national income.
We have set out a plan to invest over £100 billion in our
infrastructure over the next Parliament.
This will fund the biggest investment in rail since
Victorian times, and the most extensive improvements
to our roads since the 1970s. And it will give us the
most comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband
coverage of any major European country.
Our plan of action:
We will spend more on infrastructure, to
improve your quality of life
Overall public investment will be higher on average over
this decade, as a percentage of GDP, than under the
whole period of the last Labour Government. We will
deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond
to the Airports Commission’s final report.
We will transform our railway network
We will invest £38 billion in our railway network in the five
years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of
our investment programme, with work already underway
across the North, the Midlands, and South Wales; there
are plans to go further in the rest of the country, including
East Anglia and the South West. In addition to rolling out
our national high-speed rail network, with High Speed 2
and High Speed 3, we will complete the construction of the
new east-west Crossrail across Greater London, and push
forward with plans for Crossrail 2, a new rail route running
through London and connecting Surrey and Hertfordshire.
We will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters:
we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the
whole of the next Parliament – regulated fares will only be

Improving our trains, roads
and broadband helps local
businesses grow and create
more jobs and opportunities

We are investing over £2 billion
electrifying our railways


able to rise by Retail Price Inflation, and train operating
companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices
above this. We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-time
season tickets and require train companies to improve
compensation arrangements for passengers when trains
are more than a few minutes late. We are investing millions
of pounds in fitting out trains with new wi-fi equipment
and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit
passengers on trains across England and Wales.
We will support motorists and invest in our
roads, to save you time and money
We abolished Labour’s fuel duty escalator, and instead
have frozen fuel duty, delivering the longest duty freeze
in 20 years. We will invest £15 billion in roads. This will
include over £6 billion in the northern road network,
with the dualling and widening of the A1 north of
Newcastle and the first new trans-Pennine road capacity
in over 40 years. We will take action to tackle some of
the most notorious and longstanding problems on our
road network, including improvements to the A303,
A47 and A27. We will add 1,300 extra lane miles to our
roads, improve over 60 problem junctions, and continue
to provide enough funding to fix around 18 million
potholes nationwide between 2015 and 2021.
We will make motoring greener and promote
cycling, to protect your environment
Our aim is for almost every car and van to be a zero
emission vehicle by 2050 – and we will invest £500
million over the next five years to achieve it. We want
to double the number of journeys made by bicycle and
will invest over £200 million to make cycling safer, so we
reduce the number of cyclists and other road users killed
or injured on our roads every year.
We will deliver faster internet, to help you
work and communicate more easily
We will secure the delivery of superfast broadband in
urban and rural areas to provide coverage to 95 per
cent of the UK by the end of 2017, and we will ensure
no one is left behind by subsidising the cost of installing
superfast capable satellite services in the very hardest to
reach areas. We will also release more spectrum from
public sector use to allow greater private sector access.
And we have set an ambition that ultrafast broadband
should be available to nearly all UK premises as soon as
practicable.
We will boost mobile coverage, so you can
stay connected
We will hold the mobile operators to their new legally
binding agreement to ensure that 90 per cent of the UK
landmass will have voice and SMS coverage by 2017.
We will continue to invest in mobile infrastructure to
deliver coverage for voice calls and text messages for
the final 0.3 – 0.4 per cent of UK premises that do not
currently have it. We will ensure that Britain seizes the
chance to be a world leader in the development of 5G,
playing a key role in defining industry standards.

We are investing £790 million
extending superfast broadband
to rural areas – with 2 million
UK premises already connected
and 40,000 being upgraded
every week


- JOBS FOR ALL
Our commitment to you:
Whatever stage of life you are at – whether you’re looking for your first job out of school, or
- coming to the end of your career – we will work to help you enjoy the satisfaction and rewards
of a decent job. We will:
- help businesses to create two million new jobs, so we achieve full employment
- give businesses the most competitive taxes of any major economy
- back small firms with a major business rates review
- support three million new apprenticeships, so young people acquire the skills to succeed

If you want to live in the most vibrant and dynamic
country in the world, this election matters. Only the
Conservatives have the vision, the optimism, the ambition
and the discipline to transform Britain. That’s because we
know that a decent job is the best weapon against poverty
and the best way to provide security for families.
Thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan,
Britain is creating more jobs than the 27 other countries
of the European Union put together. That means more
people with the security of a regular pay packet. Over
the past five years, 1.9 million new jobs have been
created; 1,000 jobs for every single day that we have
been in government.
This represents a transformation in many people’s
lives; giving families more security; boosting the self-esteem
of young people taken on; and providing hope
for those who have been unemployed for years.
But we need to go further. We have set out the bold
aim of achieving full employment, with the highest
employment rate of any major economy. We want
Britain to be the best place in the world to start a
business and will create another two million jobs over
the next Parliament. We will abolish long-term youth
unemployment, and make sure that all young people
are either earning or learning. And we will make our
economy more inclusive, by removing barriers that
stop women and disabled people from participating in
our workforce.
To achieve this, we will back British businesses: cutting
red tape, lowering taxes on jobs and enterprise, getting
young people into work, boosting apprenticeships
and investing in science and technology. With the
Conservatives, Britain will be the best place in Europe
to innovate, patent new ideas and set up and expand a
business. We aim to be number one in Europe and in the
top five worldwide in the World Bank’s Doing Business
rankings by 2020 and to lead Europe in attracting foreign
investment.
Backing business also means helping our farmers and
our rural communities. Neglected for 13 years under
Labour, we have started the process of championing and
connecting up the countryside. In the coming years, we
will go further, helping our farmers, supporting British food
around the world and opening up new export markets.

A job is the best way to
provide security for families

Britain has created more
jobs than the rest of the EU
put together since 2010


This is all at risk if the Labour Party forms the government.
Their policies to spend more, borrow more and tax more
would be catastrophic for Britain’s businesses – and for all
the families thrown back into the despair of joblessness and
financial uncertainty.
Our plan of action:
We will boost apprenticeships and help you
secure a good job
We have already delivered 2.2 million new apprenticeships
over the last five years. Over the next five years, we will
deliver three million more and ensure they deliver the skills
employers need. We aim to achieve full employment in
the UK, with the highest employment rate in the G7, and
we will help businesses create two million jobs over the
Parliament. We have abolished the jobs tax – employers'
National Insurance contributions (NICs) – for the under 21s
and next year we will do the same for young apprentices
under 25. We will continue to help smaller businesses take
on new workers through the Employment Allowance, which
frees businesses from the first £2,000 of employers’ NICs so
that a third of employers pay no jobs tax.
We will aim to abolish long-term youth
unemployment
Our economic plan has helped deliver sharp falls in long-term
youth unemployment, taking the numbers of 16–18
year-olds not in education, employment or training to
historic lows. We will provide support to those 16–17 year-olds
still not in education, employment or training and to
those who risk becoming so. Jobcentre Plus advisers will work
with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and
provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships. But
it is not fair – on taxpayers, or on young people themselves
– that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip
straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to
their community. So we will introduce tougher Day One
Work Requirements for young people claiming out-of-work
benefits. We will replace the Jobseeker’s Allowance for 18-21
year-olds with a Youth Allowance that will be time-limited
to six months, after which young people will have to take an
apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work
for their benefits. It is also not fair that taxpayers should
have to pay for 18-21 year-olds on Jobseeker’s Allowance to
claim Housing Benefit in order to leave home. So we will
ensure that they no longer have an automatic entitlement to
Housing Benefit.
We will reward entrepreneurship
To support jobs, we cut Corporation Tax from 28 to 20 per
cent over the course of the Parliament, reduced National
Insurance bills and capped the rise in business rates. We
have extended 100 per cent Small Business Rate Relief
and are providing extra support for high street shops by
increasing the business rates retail discount to £1,500.
In the next Parliament, we want to maintain the most
competitive business tax regime in the G20, and oppose
Labour’s plans to increase Corporation Tax. We will
conduct a major review into business rates by the end of
2015 to ensure that from 2017 they properly reflect the
structure of our modern economy and provide clearer
billing, better information sharing and a more efficient
appeal system.
We will protect you from disruptive and
undemocratic strike action
Strikes should only ever be the result of a clear, positive
decision based on a ballot in which at least half the
workforce has voted. This turnout threshold will be an
important and fair step to rebalance the interests of
employers, employees, the public and the rights of trade
unions. We will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate
impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing
a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport.
Industrial action in these essential services would require
the support of at least 40 per cent of all those entitled
to take part in strike ballots – as well as a majority of

Our plan will help to
generate jobs and higher
wages for everybody

We will support business to
keep creating 1,000 jobs a day
over the next five years

 
those who actually turn out to vote. We will also repeal
nonsensical restrictions banning employers from hiring
agency staff to provide essential cover during strikes; and
ensure strikes cannot be called on the basis of ballots
conducted years before. We will tackle intimidation of
non-striking workers; legislate to ensure trade unions
use a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions;
tighten the rules around taxpayer-funded paid ‘facility
time’ for union representatives; and reform the role of the
Certification Officer.
We will cut red tape, boost start-ups and small
businesses
This Government was the first in post-war history to
reduce the burden of regulation. We will cut a further
£10 billion of red tape over the next Parliament
through our Red Tape Challenge and our One-In-
Two-Out rule. This will support our aim to make
Britain the best place in Europe, and one of the top five
worldwide, to do business by 2020. We will also treble
our successful Start Up Loans programme during the
next Parliament so that 75,000 entrepreneurs get the
chance to borrow money to set up their own business.
We will raise the target for SMEs’ share of central
government procurement to one-third, strengthen
the Prompt Payment Code and ensure that all major
government suppliers sign up. We have already helped
small businesses by increasing the Annual Investment
Allowance, reducing the burden of employment law
through our successful tribunal reforms and supporting
27,000 new business mentors. We will go further by
establishing a new Small Business Conciliation service
to mediate in disputes, especially over late payment.
The creation of the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS)
in 2010 has resulted in many improvements to the UK
tax system. We will establish the OTS on a permanent
basis and expand its role and capacity. We will boost our
support for first-time exporters and back the GREAT
campaign, so we achieve our goal of having 100,000
more UK companies exporting in 2020 than in 2010
and reach our target of £1 trillion in exports. And we
will set a new, significantly higher, permanent level for
the Annual Investment Allowance.
We will fight for equal opportunity
Last year alone, 140,000 disabled people found work. But
the jobless rate for this group remains too high and, as part
of our objective to achieve full employment, we will aim
to halve the disability employment gap: we will transform
policy, practice and public attitudes, so that hundreds of
thousands more disabled people who can and want to be
in work find employment. We now have more women-led
businesses than ever before, more women in work than
ever before and more women on FTSE 100 boards than
ever before. We want to see full, genuine gender equality.
The gender pay gap is the lowest on record, but we want
to reduce it further and will push business to do so: we
will require companies with more than 250 employees to
publish the difference between the average pay of their
male and female employees. Under Labour, women
accounted for only one in eight FTSE 100 board members.
They represent a quarter of board members today and we
want to see this rise further in the next Parliament. We also
want to increase the proportion of public appointments
going to women in the next Parliament, as well as the
number of female MPs.
We will back you at work
Now that the economy is growing strongly again, we have
seen the first real-terms increase in the National Minimum
Wage since Labour’s Great Recession began. We strongly
support the National Minimum Wage and want to see
further real-terms increases in the next Parliament. We

Our aim is to make Britain
the best place to do business

business tax regime in the G20 –
and we want to keep it that way

accept the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission
that the National Minimum Wage should rise to £6.70 this
autumn, on course for a Minimum Wage that will be over
£8 by the end of the decade. We also support the Living
Wage and will continue to encourage businesses and other
organisations to pay it whenever they can afford it. We will
also take further steps to eradicate abuses of workers, such
as non-payment of the Minimum Wage, exclusivity in zero-hours
contracts and exploitation of migrant workers.
We will continue to invest in science, back our
industrial strategies and make Britain the
technology centre of Europe
Great science is worthwhile in its own right and yields
enormous practical benefits too – curing diseases, driving
technological innovation, promoting business investment
and informing public policy for the better. We ring-fenced
the science budget by making difficult choices
to reduce spending in other areas. Now we will invest
new capital on a record scale – £6.9 billion in the UK’s
research infrastructure up to 2021 – which will mean new
equipment, new laboratories and new research institutes.
This long-term commitment includes £2.9 billion for a
Grand Challenges Fund, which will allow us to invest in
major research facilities of national significance, such as
the new Alan Turing Institute, and projects such as the
Polar Research Ship and Square Kilometre Array. We have
boosted research and development tax credits and we will
continue to support our network of University Enterprise
Zones, ensuring that Britain's world-beating universities are
able to make money from the technology they develop. We
will support our modern industrial strategies, such as our
successful Life Sciences strategy, to help people compete
and win in the intense global race for high value, high
knowledge jobs. We will work with the Automotive Council
in support of our resurgent car industry and direct further
resources towards the Eight Great Technologies – among
them robotics and nanotechnology – where Britain is set to
be a global leader. We have delivered a network of catapult
centres – R&D hubs in the technologies of the future –
and we will create more to ensure that we have a bold and
comprehensive offer in place for Britain’s researchers and
innovators.
We will support the rural economy and
strengthen local communities
We have the land, the technology, and the entrepreneurial
flair to enable us to make the most of the economic
potential of our rural areas. We will provide rural Britain
with near universal superfast broadband by the end of
the next Parliament and secure the future of 3,000 rural
Post Offices. We know how important it is to preserve
vital community assets such as pubs, town halls and sports
facilities, so we will strengthen the Community Right to
Bid that we created. We will extend the length of time
communities have to purchase these assets, and require
owners to set a clear ‘reserve’ price for the community
to aim for when bidding. We will set up a Pub Loan
Fund to enable community groups to obtain small loans
to pay for feasibility work, lawyers’ fees, or materials for
refurbishment, where they have bid to run the pub as part
of our reforms to the Community Asset Register.
We will champion our farmers and food
producers
We will set out a long-term vision for the future of British
farming, working with industry to develop a 25 year plan
to grow more, buy more and sell more British food. We will
allow farmers to smooth their profits for tax purposes over
five years, up from the current two years, to counter income
volatility. We will treble the number of apprenticeships in
food, farming and agri-tech, as part of our plan to secure
three million more apprenticeships. We will support a
science-led approach on GM crops and pesticides and
implement our 25-year strategy to eradicate bovine TB.
We will liberate farmers from red tape by coordinating all
visits through a single Farm Inspection Taskforce, which
will involve farmers themselves and use data from existing
industry schemes, such as Red Tractor. We will push for
further reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.
We will promote British food abroad by setting up a Great
British Food Unit to help trademark and promote local
foods around the world and back British food at home,
by guaranteeing that all central government departments
purchase food to British standards of production by the
end of the Parliament. We will also help consumers to
buy British by pushing for country of origin labelling in
Europe, particularly for dairy products, following on from

Inequality is down from the
record high it reached under Labour


our success with beef, lamb, pork and poultry. And we will
champion our new Groceries Code Adjudicator, so farmers
receive a fair deal from the supermarkets.
We will support our fishing and coastal
communities
We will defend our hard-won Common Fisheries Policy
reforms, which include ending the scandalous practice of
discarding perfectly edible fish and reforming the quota
system so that all at-risk species, including cod, plaice,
haddock and seabass, will be fished sustainably by the end
of the next Parliament. We will continue to devolve the
management of North Sea fisheries to local communities,
and rebalance the UK’s inland water quotas to smaller,
specific locally-based fishing communities.
We will support countryside pursuits
We will protect hunting, shooting and fishing, for all the
benefits to individuals, the environment and the rural
economy that these activities bring. A Conservative
Government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal
the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in
government time.


- CUTTING YOUR TAXES, MAKING WELFARE FAIRER AND CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION 
Cutting your taxes and building a fairer welfare system

Our commitment to you:
Our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but
gives everyone – no matter their background – the chance to fulfil their potential. Achieving this
means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare. We will:
- cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of
Income Tax altogether
- pass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pays Income
Tax on what they earn
- back aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold – so that no one earning less than £50,000
pays it
- cap overall welfare spending, lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive
to £23,000 and continue to roll out Universal Credit, to make work pay
- bring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work, and give working parents
of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.

Under Labour, those who worked hard found more and
more of their earnings taken away in tax to support
a welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged,
people to choose benefits when they could be earning a
living. This sent out terrible signals: if you did the right
thing, you were penalised – and if you did the wrong
thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all
infuriating hardworking people.
Over the last five years, we have cut people’s taxes
wherever possible. We have raised the tax-free Personal
Allowance to £10,600 from £6,475: over 26 million
people are now keeping more of their hard-earned
money and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying no
Income Tax at all. We believe that cutting people’s taxes
is the right thing to do – not only because it is your
money, but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest
paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the
most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.
Real fairness means that where people really cannot
work, they must be supported – but where they are
able to work, they should. We have made long overdue
changes to our welfare system. We have capped benefits
so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits
than the average household earns by going out to work.
We have begun to introduce Universal Credit – a way
to simplify benefits into a new single payment – so that
work always pays. We are reassessing those on incapacity
benefits so that help goes to those who really need it.
The days of something for nothing are over – and all
this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of
people living in workless households.
In the next Parliament, we will continue to reward hard
work: raising the tax-free Personal Allowance so that
those working 30 hours on the Minimum Wage pay

We have cut Income Tax for
over 26 million people – and
taken over 3 million people out
of Income Tax altogether


no Income Tax at all and taking hardworking people
out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to
capture only the wealthy. And we will see through our
welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out
Universal Credit, to make the system fairer and reward
hard work.
Our plan of action:
We will reward work
A Conservative Government will not increase the rates
of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next
Parliament. Instead, we will ease the burden of taxation
by raising the tax-free Personal Allowance – the amount
you can earn before you start paying tax – to £12,500.
This will cut Income Tax for 30 million people and take
everyone who earns less than £12,500 out of Income
Tax altogether. That means by the end of the decade,
one million more people on the lowest wages will be
lifted out of Income Tax, and people who work for 30
hours a week on the increased National Minimum Wage
will no longer pay any Income Tax at all. We will pass
a new law so that the Personal Allowance automatically
rises in line with the National Minimum Wage. The
new Tax Free Minimum Wage law will be applied from
the first Budget after the General Election. The change
will update the 1977 'Rooker-Wise' amendment which
forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with
inflation, meaning the Personal Allowance will now
increase more quickly.
We will back your ambition
The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the
best-off people in our country. But in the past couple of
decades, far too many have been dragged into it.
We have already announced an above-inflation increase
in the threshold next year. Now we will raise the 40p
tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less
than £50,000 pays the higher rate of Income Tax. The
800,000 people earning between £42,385 and £50,000
will no longer pay the 40p rate of tax.
We will support you as you raise your family
We will support you, whether you choose to go out to
work or stay at home to raise your children. We will
back the institution of marriage in our society, enabling
married couples to transfer £1,060 of their tax-free
income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner
is a basic rate taxpayer. This applies to civil partnerships
too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least
in line with the Personal Allowance. And we will help
families stay together and handle the stresses of modern
life by continuing to invest at least £7.5 million a year in
relationship support.
We will bring in tax-free childcare to help
parents return to work, and give working
parents of three and four year-olds 30 hours
of free childcare a week
We have already legislated to introduce tax-free
childcare in the next Parliament – worth up to £2,000
per child per year – to help parents who want to work.
We introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all
three and four-year olds and the most deprived two-year-olds. And because working families with children
under school age face particularly high childcare costs,
in the next Parliament we will give families where all
parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free
childcare for their three and four year-olds.
We will cap the UK's overall welfare spending,
to save you money
We will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending,
enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who
need it, and fair to those who pay for it too. Our overall
welfare cap will limit the amount that government

The goal of welfare reform
should be to reward hard
work and protect the
vulnerable

We will cut Income Tax for 30
million people – so that hard
work is always rewarded


can spend on certain social security benefits in the five
years from 2015-16. We will freeze working age benefits
for two years from April 2016, with exemptions for
disability and pensioner benefits – as at present – as
well as maternity allowance, statutory maternity pay,
statutory paternity pay, statutory adoption pay and
statutory sick pay. We will deliver Universal Credit,
in order to provide the right incentives for people to
work; target support at those who need it most; reduce
fraud and error; and streamline administration of the
welfare system. We will work to eliminate child poverty
and introduce better measures to drive real change
in children’s lives, by recognising the root causes of
poverty: entrenched worklessness, family breakdown,
problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency.
We will reduce the household benefit cap to
make the system fairer
We will lower the maximum amount that a single
household can claim in benefits each year from
£26,000 to £23,000, so we reward work. We will
continue to have exemptions from the cap for those
receiving Disability Living Allowance or the Personal
Independence Payment.
We will help you back into work if you have a
long-term yet treatable condition
We will make sure the hardest to help receive the support
they need for a fulfilling life. We will review how best
to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable
conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity,
back into work. People who might benefit from treatment
should get the medical help they need so they can return
to work. If they refuse a recommended treatment, we will
review whether their benefits should be reduced. We will
also provide significant new support for mental health,
benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work
benefits or being supported by Fit for Work.

A welfare system that is fair
to those who need it, and fair
to those who pay for it too:
stopping benefit cheats and
ending welfare abuse

We will lower the benefit cap
from £26,000 to £23,000 to
reward work


Controlled immigration that benefits Britain
Our commitment to you:
Our plan to control immigration will put you, your family and the British people first. We will reduce the number of people coming to our country with tough new welfare conditions and
robust enforcement. We will:
- keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the
hundreds of thousands
- control migration from the European Union, by reforming welfare rules
- clamp down on illegal immigration and abuse of the Minimum Wage
- enhance our border security and strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules
- develop a fund to ease pressure on local areas and public services.

Conservatives believe in controlled immigration, not
mass immigration. Immigration brings real benefits to
Britain – to our economy, our culture and our national
life. We will always be a party that is open, outward-looking
and welcoming to people from all around
the world. We also know that immigration must be
controlled. When immigration is out of control, it puts
pressure on schools, hospitals and transport; and it can
cause social pressures if communities find it hard to
integrate.
Between 1997 and 2009, under the last Labour
Government, we had the largest influx of people Britain
had ever seen. Their open borders policy, combined
with their failure to reform welfare, meant that for
years over 90 percent of employment growth in this
country was accounted for by foreign nationals – even
though there were 1.4 million people who spent most
of the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits. For the past
five years, we have been working to turn around the
situation we inherited.
Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus
colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students;
installed proper exit checks at our borders; cracked
down on illegal working and sham marriages; made
it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, by
restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences
and private housing; and reduced the number of
appeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with
spurious attempts to remain in the country. All of this
has made a difference. Immigration from outside the
EU has come down since 2010.
We have seen many more people from the EU coming
to Britain than originally anticipated, principally
because our economy has been growing so much more
rapidly and creating more jobs than other EU countries.
As a result, our action has not been enough to cut
annual net migration to the tens of thousands. That
ambition remains the right one. But it is clearly going to
take more time, more work and more difficult long-term
decisions to achieve. Continuing this vital work will be
our priority over the next five years.
We will negotiate new rules with the EU, so that people

We must work to control
immigration and put
Britain first

Non-EU migration cut by 13 per
cent – and economic migration
from outside the EU capped


will have to be earning here for a number of years
before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits
that top up low wages. Instead of something-for-nothing,
we will build a system based on the principle
of something-for-something. We will then put these
changes to the British people in a straight in-out
referendum on our membership of the European Union
by the end of 2017. At the same time, we will continue
to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of
our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave
at the end of their visas. Across the spectrum, from the
student route to the family and work routes, we will
build a system that truly puts you, your family and the
British people first.
Our plan of action:
We will regain control of EU migration by
reforming welfare rules
Changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be an
absolute requirement in the renegotiation. We have
already banned housing benefit for EU jobseekers, and
restricted other benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance.
We will insist that EU migrants who want to claim tax
credits and child benefit must live here and contribute
to our country for a minimum of four years. This will
reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower-skilled
workers to come to Britain. We will introduce a
new residency requirement for social housing, so that EU
migrants cannot even be considered for a council house
unless they have been living in an area for at least four
years. If an EU migrant’s child is living abroad, then
they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit,
no matter how long they have worked in the UK and
no matter how much tax they have paid. To reduce the
numbers of EU migrants coming to Britain, we will end
the ability of EU jobseekers to claim any job-seeking
benefits at all. And if jobseekers have not found a job
within six months, they will be required to leave.
We will tackle criminality and abuse of free movement
We will negotiate with the EU to introduce stronger
powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back,
and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who
abuse free movement. We want to toughen requirements
for non-EU spouses to join EU citizens, including with
an income threshold and English language test. And
when new countries are admitted to the EU in future,
we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those
new members until their economies have converged
much more closely with existing Member States.
We will continue to cut immigration from
outside the EU
We have already capped the level of skilled economic
migration from outside the EU. We will maintain our
cap at 20,700 during the next Parliament. This will
ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the
skills we really need in our economy. We will reform the
student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse
and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once
their visas expire. Our action will include clamping
down on the number of so-called ‘satellite campuses’
opened in London by universities located elsewhere
in the UK, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor
system for student visas. And as the introduction of exit
checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa
sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce
targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that
fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of
their visa.
We will strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules
We have introduced a ‘deport first, appeal later’ rule
for foreign national offenders. We will now remove
even more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to
all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including
where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart
from asylum claims. We will also implement a new
removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious
legal challenge and opportunities to abscond. We will
introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national
offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or
deportation proceedings. And we will implement the

Tougher tests for migrants
before they can claim benefits


requirement for all landlords to check the immigration
status of their tenants.
We will tackle people trafficking and exploitation
We have already re-introduced a proper system of exit
checks across the country, passed a Modern Slavery
Act that will protect people from exploitation, and
quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who
undercut the Minimum Wage. Now we will introduce
tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal
working and exploitation. To crack down further on
illegal working, we will harness data from multiple
agencies, including Exit Checks data, to identify illegal
immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers.
And to incentivise tougher action on employers who do
not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection
teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines
levied on employers.
We will ease pressure on public services and
your local community
We are taking unprecedented action to tackle health
tourism and will recover up to £500 million from
migrants who use the NHS by the middle of the next
Parliament. To help communities experiencing high and
unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introduce
a new Controlling Migration Fund to ease pressures
on services and to pay for additional immigration
enforcement. To prevent sectors becoming partially or
wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those
regularly utilising the Shortage Occupation List, under
which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the
UK, to provide long-term plans for training British
workers.
We will promote integration and British values
Being able to speak English is a fundamental part of
integrating into our society. We have introduced tough
new language tests for migrants and ensured councils
reduce spending on translation services. Next, we
will legislate to ensure that every public sector worker
operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent
English. And to encourage better integration into our
society, we will also require those coming to Britain on
a family visa with only basic English to become more
fluent over time, with new language tests for those
seeking a visa extension.

We will protect British values
and our way of life


- THE BEST SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
Giving your child the best start in life
Our commitment to you:
Your child deserves the best start in life. A good education is not a luxury; it should be a right for
everyone. We will:
- ensure a good primary school place for your child, with zero tolerance for failure
- turn every failing and coasting secondary school into an academy and deliver free
schools for parents and communities that want them
- help teachers to make Britain the best country in the world for developing maths,
engineering, science and computing skills
- create 3 million new apprenticeships and make sure there is no cap on university places,
so we have aspiration for all.

We know what works in education: great teachers;
brilliant leadership; rigour in the curriculum; discipline
in the classroom; proper exams. We have been bold in
reforming the education system to deliver these things,
based upon simple, clear principles and values. We
believe that parents and teachers should be empowered
to run their schools independently. We believe that
teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need
to attract the best graduates into it. And we believe that
there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum
to secure the best from every pupil.
We inherited a system where far too many children left
school without the qualifications and skills they needed.
One in three children was leaving primary school unable
to read, write and add up properly. The number of pupils
studying the core academic subjects at GCSE had halved.
Our schools had fallen down the global league tables
for maths and science. And the poorest children were
attending the weakest schools.
Our far-reaching education reforms have changed this. We
have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline
back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the
curriculum. Today, there are a million more pupils in
schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’. Over
a thousand schools that were ranked ‘inadequate’ have
become Academies, bringing in new leadership to promote
discipline, rigour and higher standards.
There are over 250 new free schools – set up and run by
local people – delivering better education for the children
who need it most. We have boosted the number of
apprenticeships to record levels – 2.2 million over the last
five years – and last September more people headed off to
university than at any time in history. Too many children,
however, are still not receiving the excellent education that
they deserve. So we will continue our reforms, so that every
child has the best possible start in life.
Our plan of action:
We will drive up standards in your child’s school
We have made exams more rigorous and ended grade
inflation. There is more to do. We will start by introducing
tough new standards for literacy and numeracy in primary
schools. We will expect every 11-year-old to know their
times tables off by heart and be able to perform long
division and complex multiplication. They should be
able to read a book and write a short story with accurate
punctuation, spelling and grammar. If children do not

There are a million more pupils
in schools rated by Ofsted as
‘good’ or ‘outstanding’


reach the required standards in their exams at the end
of primary school, they will resit them at the start of
secondary school, to make sure no pupil is left behind.
We will require secondary school pupils to take GCSEs
in English, maths, science, a language and history or
geography, with Ofsted unable to award its highest ratings
to schools that refuse to teach these core subjects.
We will ensure there is a good primary school
place for your child, with zero tolerance of failure
We have more than doubled Labour’s spending on new
school places. But we want to go even further, investing
at least £7 billion over the next Parliament to provide
good school places. And we will let our best headteachers
take control of failing primary schools, by expanding the
National Leaders of Education programme.
We will turn every failing and coasting secondary
school into an academy, and deliver free schools
if parents in your area want them
Over 4,000 schools are already benefiting from academy
status, giving them more power over discipline and
budgets. And nearly 800 of the worst-performing
primary schools have been taken over by experienced
academy sponsors with a proven track record of success.
This is improving education for our children. So we
will continue to expand academies, free schools, studio
schools and University Technical Colleges. Over the
next Parliament, we will open at least 500 new free
schools, resulting in 270,000 new school places. And
we will introduce new powers to force coasting schools
to accept new leadership. Any school judged by Ofsted
to be requiring improvement will be taken over by
the best headteachers – backed by expert sponsors
or high-performing neighbouring schools – unless it
can demonstrate that it has a plan to improve rapidly.
We will continue to allow all good schools to expand,
whether they are maintained schools, academies, free
schools or grammar schools.
We will continue to protect school funding
Over the last five years, we have protected the schools budget
and committed £18 billion for new school buildings, so
that children can learn in the best environment possible.
Under a future Conservative Government, the amount of
money following your child into school will be protected.
As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of
money in our schools. On current pupil number forecasts,
there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in
the next Parliament. We will continue to provide the pupil
premium, protected at current rates, so that schools receive
additional money for those from the poorest backgrounds.
We will support families by providing free meals to all
infants. And we will make schools funding fairer. We have
already increased funding for the 69 least well-funded local
authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for
their funding in the next Parliament. We will not allow state
schools to make a profit.
We will back your child’s teachers
We have already given teachers greater disciplinary powers.
In the next Parliament, we will expect every teacher to be
trained not just in how to tackle serious behaviour issues,
but also in how to deal with the low level disruption that
stops children from learning properly. This generation of
teachers is already the best-qualified ever. In future, we will
recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they
spend on paperwork, introducing bursaries for the most
in-demand subjects, paying good teachers more, further
reducing the burden of Ofsted inspections and continuing
to encourage the growth of Teach First. We will increase
the number of teachers able to teach Mandarin in schools
in England, so we can compete in the global race. We want
teachers to be regarded in the same way as other highly
skilled professionals, so we are supporting the creation
of an independent College of Teaching to promote the
highest standards of teaching and school leadership.
We will lead the world in maths and science
We have increased the time schools will spend on maths,
and ensured that children learn to code as soon as they
start school. Maths is now the most popular A-level subject.
We aim to make Britain the best place in the world to study
maths, science and engineering, measured by improved
performance in the PISA league tables. To help achieve
this, we will train an extra 17,500 maths and physics

Every school needs high
standards, proper funding
and accountability


teachers over the next five years. We will make sure that all
students are pushed to achieve their potential and create
more opportunities to stretch the most able.
We will protect children
Every child deserves a warm, loving home, and to feel safe
online and at school. We have made improving support
for children and young people with special educational
needs and disabilities a priority. We have created 2,200
more special schools places through our free schools
programme, introduced a coordinated assessment process
to determine a child or young person’s needs, and funded
degree-level specialist training for teachers and support
staff. And to make sure it’s working, Ofsted now formally
inspects local areas for their effectiveness in fulfilling their
new duties. We have made progress in reforming our
adoption system, but there is more to do. We will introduce
regional adoption agencies, working across local authority
boundaries to match children with the best parents for
them. We will continue to raise the quality of children’s
social work, by expanding training programmes, such as
Frontline, and creating new opportunities to develop the
next generation of leaders in the field. We will continue to
tackle all forms of bullying in our schools. And we will stop
children's exposure to harmful sexualised content online, by
requiring age verification for access to all sites containing
pornographic material and age-rating for all music videos.
We will improve skills training
We have given employers much more control over
apprenticeship courses, so they teach skills relevant to
the workplace. We will continue to replace lower-level,
classroom-based Further Education courses with high-quality
apprenticeships that combine training with
experience of work and a wage. We will ensure there is a
University Technical College within reach of every city. We
will abolish employers' National Insurance contributions
on earnings up to the upper earnings limit for apprentices
under the age of 25. And we will roll out many more
Degree Apprenticeships, allowing young people to combine
a world-class degree with a world-class apprenticeship.
We will improve Further Education
We will continue to improve Further Education through
our network of National Colleges, which will provide
specialist higher-level vocational training in sectors critical
to economic growth. We will publish more earnings and
destination data for Further Education courses, and require
more accreditation of courses by employers.
We will ensure that if you want to go to university,
you can
This year, for the first time, over half a million people
have been admitted to our universities, including a record
proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
From September, we will go even further, abolishing the
cap on higher education student numbers and removing
an arbitrary ceiling on ambition. Our reforms to university
funding mean you do not have to pay anything towards
tuition while studying, and only start paying back if you earn
over £21,000 per year. We will ensure the continuing success
and stability of these reforms, so that the interests of both
students and taxpayers are fairly represented. We will also
introduce a national postgraduate loan system for taught
masters and PhD courses. We will ensure that universities
deliver the best possible value for money to students: we
will introduce a framework to recognise universities offering
the highest teaching quality; encourage universities to
offer more two-year courses; and require more data to be
openly available to potential students so that they can make
decisions informed by the career paths of past graduates.
We will ensure that our universities remain
world-leading
We will maintain our universities’ reputation for world-class
research and academic excellence. Through the Nurse
Review of research councils, we will seek to ensure that the
UK continues to support world-leading science, and invests
public money in the best possible way. And we will encourage
the development of online education as a tool for students,
whether studying independently or in our universities.

Protecting and improving our
National Health Service
Our commitment to you:
Our National Health Service must be there for you throughout your life. We will:
- continue to increase spending on the NHS, supported by a strong economy, so the NHS
stays free for you to use
- spend at least an additional £8 billion by 2020 over and above inflation to fund and
support the NHS’s own action plan for the next five years
- ensure you can see a GP and receive the hospital care you need, 7 days a week by 2020, with
a guarantee that everyone over 75 will get a same-day appointment if they need one
- integrate health and social care, through our Better Care Fund
- lead the world in fighting cancer and finding a cure for dementia
The NHS is vitally important to all of us. Founded on
the principle that no one should ever have to worry about
their ability to pay for their healthcare, it is a profound
expression of our values as a nation.
Patients, doctors and nurses are the experts on how
to improve people’s health. So we have given greater
power and accountability to the frontline than any other
government. We cleared out bureaucracy, generating
savings which we have invested in care for patients.
Instead of chasing managerial targets, we have focused on
outcomes and performance. And we have given patients
more power by providing them with more information.
Under Labour, micro-management from Whitehall
clogged-up the system. A cover-up culture developed,
where doctors and nurses were scared to speak out about
the appalling standards of care at hospitals in places such
as Stafford and Morecambe Bay. By the time Labour left
office, our cancer survival rates lagged far behind those of
other countries, and more than 18,000 patients had been
waiting for over a year to start their treatment.
We are putting things right. We protected the NHS budget.
Our doctors and nurses are now doing over a million
more operations each year than in 2010. Our Cancer
Drugs Fund has given more than 60,000 people access to
life-saving drugs. We have doubled funding for dementia
research. Hospital infections have halved. An independent
think tank, the Commonwealth Fund, has found that
under the Conservatives the NHS has become the best
healthcare system of any major country. And patients are
reporting the highest levels of satisfaction for years. The
NHS is performing well in the face of increasing demand,
with fewer patients waiting longer than the 18, 26 and
52 week targets than in May 2010. We have slashed the
number of people who wait over a year for the treatment
they need, from over 18,000 to under 500.
Despite this progress, our NHS faces major challenges.
An ageing population will place more pressure on health
and social care, and life-saving but expensive new drugs
will push up costs. And for years it’s been too hard to
access the NHS out of hours, even though sudden illness
and events which you and your family cannot plan for do
not respect normal working hours. We will rise to these
challenges. By building a strong economy, we will be able
to increase spending in real terms every year. With a future
Conservative Government, you will have a truly 7-day
NHS, at the frontier of science, offering you new drugs and
treatments, safeguarded for years to come.

We are building an NHS that is
more efficient, more effective
and more accountable


Our plan of action:
We will deliver a strong NHS through a strong
economy
We are set to increase health spending by more than £7
billion above and beyond inflation in the five years since
2010. And we will continue spend more on the NHS, in
real terms, every year. The NHS is more efficient now
than it has ever been. We will implement the NHS’s own
plan to improve health care even further – the Five Year
Forward View. Because of our long-term economic plan,
we are able to commit to increasing NHS spending in
England in real terms by a minimum of £8 billion over
the next five years. Combined with the efficiencies that the
NHS Forward View sets out, this will provide the funding
necessary to implement this plan in full.
We will make the NHS more convenient
for you
We want England to be the first nation in the world to
provide a truly 7 day NHS. Already millions more people
can see a GP 7 days a week, from 8am-8pm, but by 2020 we
want this for everyone. We will now go further, with hospitals
properly staffed, so that the quality of care is the same
every day of the week. We will restore your right to access a
specific, named GP – something that Labour abolished. We
will ensure that your family doctor appointments and repeat
prescriptions are routinely available online, wherever you
live. And we will guarantee same-day GP appointments for
all over 75s who need them.
We will offer you the safest and most
compassionate care in the world
We will ensure that English hospitals and GP surgeries
are the safest in the world, places where you are treated
with dignity and respect. We will continue to eliminate
mixed-sex wards and hospital infections. We will ensure
that the NHS is accountable when mistakes are made, and
implement the recommendations of the independent review
into the Stafford Hospital scandal. We will ensure that the
independent Care Quality Commission rates all hospitals,
care homes and GP surgeries. We introduced expert Chief
Inspectors to promote excellence and root out poor care, and
we will continue to back them. We are deeply proud of our
NHS staff, who are the best in the world. Over the last five
years, we have hired thousands more doctors and nurses. We
will continue to ensure that we have enough doctors, nurses
and other staff to meet patients’ needs, and consider how
best to recognise and reward high performance.
We will help you make informed choices about
your healthcare
We will improve standards in all areas of care. In 2013
we introduced the friends and family test so you could
provide feedback on the care and treatment you received;
we aim to increase the proportion of people who rate
their experience as ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’. We will boost
transparency even further, ensuring you can access full
information about the safety record of your hospital and
other NHS or independent providers, and give patients
greater choice over where and how they receive care. We
will give you full access to your own electronic health
records, while retaining your right to opt-out of your
records being shared electronically.
We will support you and your family to stay
healthy
We are helping people to stay healthy by ending the open
display of tobacco in shops, introducing plain–packaged
cigarettes and funding local authority public health budgets.
We will take action to reduce childhood obesity and continue
to promote clear food information. We will support people
struggling with addictions and undertake a review into how

We are prioritising resources
to frontline services – with 9,500
more doctors and 6,900 more nurses

We have increased the NHS

best to support those suffering from long-term yet treatable
conditions, such as drug or alcohol addiction, or obesity,
back in to work. We will be the first country to implement a
national, evidence-based diabetes prevention programme.
And we will invest more in primary care, to help prevent
health problems before they start.
We will ensure you receive the best healthcare
We will speed up your access to new medicines by
implementing the findings of our Innovative Medicines
and Medical Technology Review. We will increase the
use of cost-effective new medicines and technologies, and
encourage large-scale trials of innovative technologies and
health services. Antibiotic resistance is a major health risk
so we will continue to lead the global fight against it, taking
forward the recommendations of the independent review
launched by the Prime Minister, David Cameron. And
we will support our long-term economic plan by fostering
research, innovation and jobs in the life science industry.
We will help if you or your loved ones are
affected by cancer
Cancer survival rates are improving, and are now the best
they have ever been. We will continue to invest in our lifesaving
Cancer Drugs Fund. We will work with the NHS,
charities and patient groups to deliver the new strategy
recommended by NHS England’s cancer taskforce.
This will improve survival rates and save thousands of
lives through enhanced prevention, earlier detection
and diagnosis, and better treatment and care. We will
continue to support research to improve the diagnosis and
treatment of rare diseases and cancers, including through
decoding 100,000 whole genomes. This will help scientists
and doctors understand diseases better, and design more
effective, personalised treatments.
We will continue to take your mental health as
seriously as your physical health
We have legislated to ensure that mental and physical
health conditions are given equal priority. We will now
go further, ensuring that there are therapists in every
part of the country providing treatment for those who
need it. We are increasing funding for mental health
care. We will enforce the new access and waiting time
standards for people experiencing mental ill-health,
including children and young people. Building on our
success in training thousands of nurses and midwives
to become health visitors, we will ensure that women
have access to mental health support during and after
pregnancy, while strengthening the health visiting
programme for new mothers.
We will ensure that people can grow old in
comfort and dignity
We have led the world on fighting dementia, and will
deliver our strategy – the Prime Minister’s Challenge on
Dementia 2020 – making sure that everyone diagnosed
with the condition gets a meaningful care plan to support
them and their family. We will increase support for fulltime
unpaid carers. We will guarantee that you will not
have to sell your home to fund your residential social care.
Too many people spend their last days in hospital when
they would prefer to die closer to home; we will support
commissioners to combine better health and social care
services for the terminally ill so that more people are able to
die in a place of their choice. We will continue to integrate
the health and social care systems, joining-up services
between homes, clinics and hospitals, including through
piloting new approaches like the pooling of around
£6 billion of health and social care funding in Greater
Manchester and the £5.3 billion Better Care Fund.

Over 60,000 people have
benefited from the Cancer Drugs Fund

Enabling you to enjoy our heritage, creativity and sports
Our commitment to you:
Wherever you live in the country, we want you to be able to enjoy the best our culture and
sports have to offer. We will:
- keep our major national museums and galleries free to enter
- support school sport, build on our Olympic and Paralympic legacy, and deliver the Rugby
and Cricket World Cups and the World Athletics Championships
- freeze the BBC licence fee, to save you money
- support our creative industries and defend a free media

One of the highlights of the past five years was the
London Olympic and Paralympic Games. Those weeks
in 2012 demonstrated the best of our country. When the
pressure is on, we deliver; when the stakes are high, we
come together; when it comes to taking on the world, we
can win.
We may not be the biggest country, but our museums
are second to none. In music, art, fashion, theatre,
design, film, television and the performing arts, we
have an edge. Conservatives understand these things
do not just enhance our national prestige and boost
our economy; they help tie our country together,
strengthening the bonds between all of us.
That’s why, despite all the economic chaos we inherited,
we have put over £8 billion of public and Lottery
funding into the arts, heritage, museums and galleries
during the last five years. We have also boosted school
sports and increased the share of National Lottery
funding going to good causes.
Our plan of action:
We will support our world-leading museums,
galleries and heritage
We will keep our major national museums and galleries
free to enter and enable our cultural institutions to benefit
from greater financial autonomy to use their budgets as
they see fit. Over the last five years, we have made sure that
arts funding benefits the whole of the UK. We will support
a Great Exhibition in the North; back plans for a new
theatre, The Factory, Manchester; and help the Manchester
Museum, in partnership with the British Museum, to
establish a new India Gallery. We are also supporting plans
to develop a modern world class concert hall for London.
We will ensure the protection and enjoyment of one
our most ancient and precious heritage sites by building
a tunnel where the A303 passes closest to Stonehenge.
We significantly increased National Lottery funding for
heritage and have created a brand new heritage charity –
English Heritage – to support more than 400 buildings and
monuments. And we will continue to support essential roof
repairs for our cathedrals and churches, along with other
places of worship.
We will continue to support local libraries
We will help public libraries to support local
communities by providing free wi-fi. And we will assist
them in embracing the digital age by working with them
Culture and sport help
bring us closer together as
a nation, strengthening the
bonds between all of us


to ensure remote access to e-books, without charge
and with appropriate compensation for authors that
enhances the Public Lending Right scheme.
We will support our media
A free media is the bedrock of an open society. We
will deliver a comprehensive review of the BBC Royal
Charter, ensuring it delivers value for money for the
licence fee payer, while maintaining a world class service
and supporting our creative industries. That is why
we froze the BBC licence fee and will keep it frozen,
pending Charter renewal. And we will continue to ‘top-slice’
the licence fee for digital infrastructure to support
superfast broadband across the country.
We will defend press freedom
We will continue to defend hard-won liberties and the
operation of a free press. But alongside the media’s
rights comes a clear responsibility, which is why we set
up the public, judge-led Leveson Inquiry in response
to the phone-hacking scandal, created a new watchdog
by Royal Charter and legislated to toughen media libel
laws. Because the work of the free press is so important
we will offer explicit protection for the role of journalists
via the British Bill of Rights and we will ban the police
from accessing journalists’ phone records to identify
whistle-blowers and other sources without prior judicial
approval. Local newspapers are an important source of
information for local communities and a vital part of a
healthy democracy. To support them as they adapt to
new technology and changing circumstances, we will
consult on the introduction of a business rates relief for
local newspapers in England.
We will support our creative industries
The creative industries have become our fastest-growing
economic sector, contributing nearly £77 billion to the
UK economy – driven in part by the tax incentives for
films, theatre, video games, animation and orchestras
we introduced. Our support for the film industry
has resulted in great British films and encouraged
Hollywood’s finest to flock to the UK. We will continue
these reliefs, with a tax credit for children’s television
next year, and expand them when possible. We will
protect intellectual property by continuing to require
internet service providers to block sites that carry large
amounts of illegal content, including their proxies. And
we will build on progress made under our voluntary
anti-piracy projects to warn internet users when they are
breaching copyright. We will work to ensure that search
engines do not link to the worst-offending sites.
We will continue to support tourism
in our country
Our tourism industry already supports three million jobs
and is one of the nation’s leading employers and export
earners. We will set challenging targets for Visit Britain
and Visit England to ensure more visitors travel outside
the capital. We will simplify and speed up visa issuance
for tourists. And because tourism is an industry that
depends more than most on young people, we will step
up efforts to recruit more apprentices into the business.
We will build on our Olympic and
Paralympic legacy
We want our sportsmen and women to win even more
medals in Rio 2016 than they did in London 2012. So
we will continue to support elite sports funding as part
of our Olympic and Paralympic legacy. We will deliver
the Rugby World Cup in 2015, the World Athletics
Championship in 2017, IPC World Championships in
2017 and the Cricket World Cup in 2019, maximising
the opportunities for tourism and jobs. We will support
new sports in the UK, in particular through greater links
with the US National Football League, the National
Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, with
the ultimate ambition of new franchises being based here.
We will boost sport in your community
We have already boosted funding for sport in primary
schools and over 18,000 schools have registered to
take part in our School Games. We will go further,
supporting primary school sport with £150 million a
year, paid directly to head-teachers, until 2020. This will
make sure that all primary schoolchildren benefit from

School Games supported with
over £150 million of National
Lottery and public money


a minimum of two hours high-class sport and PE each
week. We will improve the quality of Community Sports
facilities, working with local authorities, the Football
Association and the Premier League to fund investment
in artificial football pitches in more than 30 cities across
England. We will continue to invest in participation
and physical activity, recognising sport’s vital benefits
to health and to NHS England’s campaign to prevent
diabetes. We will lift the number of women on national
sports governing bodies to at least 25 per cent by 2017,
and seek to increase participation in sport by women
and girls.


Helping you build the Big Society
Our commitment to you:
Building the Big Society is about involving the people, neighbourhoods, villages, towns and cities of Britain in the great task of improving our country – and giving young people the power and
opportunity to play a real part in their community. We will:
- guarantee your child a place on National Citizen Service, so they can learn new skills and
- meet young people from different walks of life
- promote equal treatment and equal opportunity for all in a society proud of its tolerance and diversity
- give those who work for a big company and the public sector a new workplace entitlement to Volunteering Leave for three days a year, on full pay.

The Big Society is a vision of a more engaged nation, one
in which we take more responsibility for ourselves and our
neighbours; communities working together, not depending
on remote and impersonal bureaucracies. Of course, there
are many tasks which require the resources and grip of
government. But there are also many areas of national
life in which we need more people to step forward, take
responsibility and play their part. This is about a national
culture change, saying to everyone in Britain: ask what you
can do for your community and your country.
In the past five years, there has been real progress.
Volunteering is now at a ten-year high, with over three
million more adults giving their time last year than in
the year to March 2010. Charitable donations are on the
up, with one million more people giving to good causes
than at the end of the last Parliament. There are now
parents’ groups and charities running their own free
schools. There are social enterprises helping people into
jobs through the Work Programme. We have launched
the world’s first social investment bank, introduced more
social impact bonds than the rest of the world combined
and highlighted the great work done in communities
with the Big Society Awards and the Prime Minister’s
Points of Light award.
A generation of teenagers has undertaken National
Citizen Service (NCS), developing their skills, broadening
their horizons and growing in confidence; over the next
five years, we will expand NCS – so it becomes a rite of
passage for young people in our country. We will give
more people the power and support to run a school, start
their own social enterprise, and take over their own local
parks, landmarks and pubs. We will encourage the 1,400
communities engaged in neighbourhood planning to
complete the process and assist others to draw up their
own plans. And we will take new steps to encourage
volunteering, enabling more people to join the unsung
heroes who are the backbone of communities across
Britain.
Our plan of action:
We will expand National Citizen Service
Over 130,000 young people have graduated from NCS
and we have now guaranteed a place on NCS for every
16 and 17-year-old who wants one. In addition to this,
we will increase the number of cadet units in schools, so
that more students have the chance to learn skills such as
leadership and self-reliance.

Volunteering is at a 10-year
high, with 3 million more adults
giving their time last year than
in 2010


We will innovate in how we deliver public
services
We have pioneered ways to deliver high-quality public
services, including through getting the voluntary sector
more involved. For example, our Work Programme has
helped harness the talent and energy of charities to help
people turn their lives around and find their way back
into work. We will examine ways to build on this type of
innovative approach in the future. We have also pioneered
the use of social impact bonds and payment-by-results,
and we will look to scale these up in the future, focusing on
youth unemployment, mental health and homelessness.
We will help you volunteer and support action
to help the vulnerable
We will support the Prince of Wales’ Step Up To Serve
initiative, encouraging young people to serve in their
community. And we will make volunteering for three
days a year a workplace entitlement for people working in
large companies and the public sector. People could, for
example, volunteer for a local charity or serve as a school
governor. We have always believed that churches, faith
groups and other voluntary groups play an important and
longstanding role in this country’s social fabric, running
foodbanks, helping the homeless, and tackling debt and
addictions, such as alcoholism and gambling. We have
already introduced tougher regulation of gambling, with
enhanced player protections and planning controls to
prevent the further proliferation of high street betting
shops; we've capped payday lending and backed financial
inclusion; and will continue to support action that helps
vulnerable people get the assistance they need.
We will champion equal rights and correct
past wrongs
Our historic introduction of gay marriage has helped
drive forward equality and strengthened the institution
of marriage. But there is still more to do, and we
will continue to champion equality for Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender people. We will build on the
posthumous pardon of Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing,
who committed suicide following his conviction for gross
indecency, with a broader measure to lift the blight of
outdated convictions of this nature. Thousands of British
men still suffer from similar historic charges, even though
they would be completely innocent of any crime today.
Many others are dead and cannot correct this injustice
themselves through the legal process we have introduced
while in government. So we will introduce a new law that
will pardon those people, and right these wrongs.

Over 130,000 young people
have taken part in National Citizen Service


Making government work better for you
Our commitment to you:
The government is the servant of the British people. Every pound spent must be scrutinised, and
government run as efficiently and effectively as possible. We will:
- save you money by cutting government waste
- put more of the essential services you use online, to make them more convenient
- continue to make government more transparent, so you can hold us to account for how your money is being spent.

Government is the servant of the British people, not
their master. That simple fact was forgotten when
Labour was in power. Quangos grew in number,
wasteful projects proliferated and the bureaucracy
swelled – symptoms of a Government that believed it
always knew best.
Conservatives have brought in a new approach. We
are determined to measure success not by how much
money is spent, but how much it improves people’s
lives. Whitehall is now leaner and smaller than at any
time since the Second World War. We have halved
the running costs of the Department for Education.
We have abolished or merged over 300 quangos. We
have moved paperwork online. We have shone a bright
light on government spending – requiring all central
government spending over £25,000 to be published
online. We have also ensured that people receive a
transparent breakdown of how their taxes are spent.
In the next five years, we will ensure this efficiency
revolution continues. We will also continue to reform our
political system: make votes of more equal value through
long overdue boundary reforms, reducing the number of
MPs and ensuring the Electoral Commission does more
to tackle voting fraud. These measures will help to restore
public confidence in British politics.
Our plan of action:
We will cut government waste
We have reduced the cost of government, by selling
empty buildings, managing big projects better, shrinking
the Civil Service, reforming pensions, moving more
services online, and improving contracting. We plan a
further £10 billion annual savings by 2017-18 and £15-20 billion in 2019-20.

Hardworking taxpayers

accountable

To eliminate the deficit, we
must continue to cut out
wasteful spending

£14.3 billion was saved in
2014 through efficiencies in
government – equivalent to
nearly £850 for every working
household


We will deliver better public services and more
open government
We have supported the growth of public service mutuals –
organisations that are owned by their staff and deliver public
services. We want more of them, so we will guarantee a
‘right to mutualise’ within the public sector. This will free up
the entrepreneurial spirit of public servants and yield better
value for money for taxpayers. Transparency has also been
at the heart of our approach to government. Over the last
five years, we have been open about government spending,
provided access to taxpayer-funded research, pursued
open data and helped establish the Open Government
Partnership. We will continue to be the most transparent
government in the world. We addressed public concern
about the influence of money on politics, with a law that
strengthened rules governing non-party campaigning
and established a register of consultant lobbyists. In the
next Parliament, we will legislate to ensure trade unions
use a transparent opt-in process for subscriptions to
political parties. We will continue to seek agreement on a
comprehensive package of party funding reform.
We will make government more efficient
We value our outstanding public servants. Over the last five
years, we have made efficiencies in government. We have
ruled out the introduction of regional pay in the public
sector, which we do not support and will not introduce.
Britain's impartial, professional and highly capable Civil
Service is admired around the world and one of our nation's
strengths. We will push ahead with reform of the Civil
Service to make it more dynamic and streamlined. We
will make recruitment to the Civil Service more open and
actively look for exceptional talent, especially in areas where
capabilities are in short supply. We will continue to tackle
all the bureaucracy of Whitehall that clogs the arteries of
government. We will end taxpayer-funded six-figure payoffs
for the best paid public sector workers. We will continue to
sell unneeded government property and co-locate services
wherever possible. We have already created 20 high-quality
digital services, which include apprenticeships applications
and tax self-assessments. We will save you time, hassle and
money by moving more services online, while actively
tackling digital exclusion. We will ensure digital assistance is
always available for those who are not online, while rolling
out cross-government technology platforms to cut costs and
improve productivity – such as GOV.UK.
We will reform Parliament
We have improved the operation of Parliament,
strengthening its ability to hold the Government to account,
with reforms such as the election of Select Committee chairs
and the creation of the Backbench Business Committee,
which enables backbenchers, for the first time, to determine
a significant proportion of the House of Commons’
business. We have also passed the Fixed Term Parliament
Act, an unprecedented transfer of Executive power. In
the next Parliament, we will address the unfairness of the
current Parliamentary boundaries, reduce the number
of MPs to 600 to cut the cost of politics and make votes
of more equal value. We will implement the boundary
reforms that Parliament has already approved and make
them apply automatically once the Boundary Commission
reports in 2018. This will deal with the fact that the current
electoral layout over-represents parts of the country where
populations have been falling and under-represents parts
where populations have been rising.
We will ensure that the House of Lords fulfils
its valuable role as a chamber of legislative
scrutiny and revision
While we still see a strong case for introducing an elected
element into our second chamber, this is not a priority in
the next Parliament. We have already allowed for expulsion
of members for poor conduct and will ensure the House of
Lords continues to work well by addressing issues such as the
size of the chamber and the retirement of peers.
We will protect our electoral system, to
safeguard our democracy
Building on our introduction of individual voter
registration, we will continue to make our arrangements
fair and effective by ensuring the Electoral Commission
puts greater priority on tackling fraud and considers
insisting on proof of ID to vote. We will complete the
electoral register, by working to include more of the five
million Britons who live abroad. We will introduce votes for
life, scrapping the rule that bars British citizens who have
lived abroad for more than 15 years from voting. We will
respect the will of the British people, as expressed in the
2011 referendum, and keep First Past the Post for elections
to the House of Commons. And we will introduce English
votes for English laws, answering the longstanding West
Lothian Question in our democracy.


- SECURING YOUR HOME AND YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
Helping you to buy a home of your own
Our commitment to you:
The chance to own your own home should be available to everyone who works hard. We will:
- help to keep mortgage rates lower by continuing to work through our long-term
economic plan
- build more homes that people can afford, including 200,000 new Starter Homes exclusively
for first-time buyers under 40
- extend the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme to 2020 to help more people onto and up the
housing ladder, and introduce a new Help to Buy ISA to support people saving for a deposit
- give more people the chance to own their home by extending the Right to Buy to tenants of
Housing Associations and create a Brownfield Fund to unlock homes on brownfield land
- ensure local people have more control over planning and protect the Green Belt

Conservatives believe passionately in home ownership.
We understand how good it feels when you have worked
long hours, saved money for years, and finally take
possession of the keys to your first home. For years,
however, people have been finding it harder and harder
to get on the housing ladder. Under Labour, housebuilding
fell to its lowest peacetime level since the
1920s. Developers were building too few homes and
the aftermath of the banking crisis saw young people
struggling to raise a deposit.
These past five years have been about reversing this
trend. We have unblocked the planning system, to help
builders start building again. We have introduced Help
to Buy, making it much easier for people to secure a
mortgage. And we have reinvigorated the Right to Buy
which Labour had cut back, extending home ownership
to a whole new generation of social tenants. As a result,
over 200,000 people have been helped either on or up
the housing ladder. Most of those helped have been
young first-time buyers spread right across our country.
As the party of home ownership, we want to go further
and faster – and this manifesto sets out our plan. At its
heart, a clear objective to build affordable homes, including
200,000 Starter Homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent
discount, and will be built exclusively for first time buyers
under the age of 40. At the same time, we will extend our
Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme, introduce a new Help to
Buy ISA, extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association
tenants and make sure that, when it comes to planning
decisions, local people are in charge.
And for all those already in their home, we will make
sure we continue working through our economic plan,
so mortgage rates stay lower for longer and people
can keep hold of their homes and plan for the future
– safe in the knowledge they have a government that is
competently looking after the public finances so they
can look after their own.

Everyone who works hard
should be able to own a home of their own

House building at its highest
since 2007


Our plan of action:
We will double the number of first-time
buyers, and help more people own their
own home
We are setting an ambition to double the number of
first-time buyers compared to the last five years – helping
one million more people to own their own home. We will
extend Help to Buy to cover another 120,000 homes – in
total helping over 200,000 people and we will continue
the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee until the start of
2017, and the Help to Buy equity loan until at least 2020.
From this autumn, we will introduce a new Help to Buy
ISA to support people who are working hard to save up
for a deposit for their first home. A ten per cent deposit
on the average first home costs £15,000, so if you put
in up to £12,000, government will put in up to £3,000
more. A 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving a
deposit from your pre-tax income – making it effectively a
tax cut for first-time buyers.
We will build 200,000 Starter Homes and
more affordable housing
We will build 200,000 quality Starter Homes over the
course of the next Parliament, reserved for first-time
buyers under 40 and sold at 20 per cent below the market
price. We have delivered over 217,000 new affordable
homes since 2010. We will now go further, delivering
275,000 additional affordable homes by 2020. And we
will offer 10,000 new homes to rent at below market rates,
to help people save for a deposit.
We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in
Housing Associations
We will extend the Right to Buy to tenants in Housing
Associations to enable more people to buy a home of
their own. It is unfair that they should miss out on a
right enjoyed by tenants in local authority homes. We
will fund the replacement of properties sold under the
extended Right to Buy by requiring local authorities to
manage their housing assets more efficiently, with the
most expensive properties sold off and replaced as they
fall vacant. We will also create a Brownfield Fund to
unlock homes on brownfield land for additional housing.
We will give you the Right to Build
We aim at least to double the number of custom-built
and self-built homes by 2020, and we will take forward
a new Right to Build, requiring councils to allocate land
to local people to build or commission their own home,
as you can do in most of Europe.
We will protect the Green Belt
We have safeguarded national Green Belt protection
and increased protection of important green spaces.
We have abolished the Labour Government’s top-down
Regional Strategies which sought to delete the Green
Belt in and around 30 towns and cities and introduced
a new Local Green Space planning designation which
allows councils and neighbourhood plans to give added
protection to valuable local green spaces.
We will support locally-led garden cities and
towns and prioritise brownfield development,
making sure new homes are always matched by
the necessary infrastructure to support them
We will support locally-led garden cities and towns in
places where communities want them, such as Ebbsfleet
and Bicester. When new homes are granted planning
permission, we will make sure local communities
know up-front that necessary infrastructure such as
schools and roads will be provided. We will ensure that
brownfield land is used as much as possible for new
development. We will require local authorities to have a
register of what is available, and ensure that 90 per cent

We will continue to work
through our plan, so
mortgage rates stay lower
for longer

Our new Help to Buy ISA
will support people who are
working hard to save for a
deposit


of suitable brownfield sites have planning permission for
housing by 2020. To meet the capital’s housing needs,
we will create a new London Land Commission, with a
mandate to identify and release all surplus brownfield
land owned by the public sector. We will fund Housing
Zones to transform brownfield sites into new housing,
which will create 95,000 new homes.
We will help keep your council taxes low
Under this Government, average council tax bills in
England have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per cent.
Whereas Labour wants to propose a new tax on family
homes, we will help local authorities keep council tax
low for hardworking taxpayers, and ensure residents
can continue to veto high rises via a local referendum.
And in London, where there is a Conservative Mayor,
bills have fallen even further. We will continue to work
with councillors to deliver high quality, value for money
services. We will encourage voluntary integration of
services and administration between and within councils –
for example, with the Troubled Families Programme and
the Better Care Fund – to promote savings and improve
local services. We want local councils to help manage
public land and buildings, and will give them at least a 10
per cent stake in public sector land sales in their area.
We will help you build a strong local economy
We want local authorities to help create strong local
economies. Building on the local retention of business
rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by
allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the
business rates revenue that is generated in their area.
This will provide a strong financial incentive for councils
to promote economic growth. We will review how we
can further reduce ring-fencing and remove Whitehall
burdens to give councils more flexibility to support
local services. We will support Business Improvement
Districts and other forms of business-led collaboration
on high streets – giving more say to local traders on
issues such as minor planning applications, cleaning and
parking. We will continue to support local shops and
residents in tackling aggressive parking enforcement and
excessive parking charges, and take steps to tackle rogue
and unfair practices by private parking operators. Our
Coastal Communities Fund will help our seaside areas
thrive, helping to boost skills and create jobs.

Protecting and enhancing our natural environment
Our commitment to you:
We set ourselves the goal of being the first generation to leave the natural environment of
England in a better state than that in which we found it. This is a big ambition to which we
remain committed. We will:
- put in place a new ‘Blue Belt’ to protect precious marine habitats
- invest in cleaner air and water for you and your family
- keep our forests in trust for the nation

For Conservatives, Britain’s ‘green and pleasant land’
is not some relic from a bygone era, to be mourned
and missed: it’s the living, breathing backdrop to our
national life. Our moors and meadows, wildlife and
nature, air and water are a crucial part of our national
identity and make our country what it is. So we care
about them deeply, want to protect them for everyone
and pass them onto future generations.
Labour never understood this. Our rural communities
fell further behind urban areas; biodiversity suffered,
with important species and habitats declining under
their watch; and they failed to protect the Green Belt.
Over the last five years, we have committed billions of
pounds to reduce emissions from transport and clean up
our rivers and seas. We have done more to protect our
seas, safeguarded our Green Belt and planted 11 million
trees. And we set out a comprehensive, long-term vision
to protect our natural heritage in this country’s first
White Paper on the Natural Environment for 20 years.
Over the next five years, we will put in place stronger
protections for our natural landscapes, establish a new
Blue Belt to safeguard precious marine habitats, launch
a programme of pocket parks in towns and cities and
continue to lead in tackling the illegal wildlife trade.
Our plan is to conserve and enhance our natural
environment so that this remains the most beautiful
country in the world.
Our plan of action:
We will protect your countryside, Green Belt
and urban environment
We will spend £3 billion from the Common Agricultural
Policy to enhance England’s countryside over the next five
years, enabling us, among other things, to clean up our
rivers and lakes, protect our stonewalls and hedges, and help
our bees to thrive. We will ensure that our public forests
and woodland are kept in trust for the nation and plant
another 11 million trees. We will make it easier to access our
beautiful landscapes, by providing free, comprehensive maps
of all open-access green space. Building on our introduction
of a five pence charge on single-use plastic bags, we will
review the case for higher Fixed Penalty Notices for littering
and allow councils to tackle small-scale fly-tipping through
Fixed Penalties rather than costly prosecutions. We will
launch an ambitious programme of pocket parks – small
areas of inviting public space where people can enjoy relief
from the hustle and bustle of city streets. We will protect the
Green Belt, and maintain national protections for Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Sites of Special
Scientific Interest and other environmental designations.
We will help you enjoy cleaner air and water
We will continue to do even more to tackle air pollution
and clean up our rivers and waterways, including
supporting the Thames Tideway Tunnel. We have
spent over £3 billion on improving flood defences, and
capped the cost of flood insurance. We will now go
further, building 1,400 new flood defence schemes, to
protect 300,000 homes.


We will build new infrastructure in an
environmentally-sensitive way
We will build new roads and railways in a way that limits,
as far as possible, their impact on the environment. This
includes investing £300 million in cutting light pollution
from new roads, doing more tunnelling, building better
noise barriers and helping to restore lost habitat. We
will also replace locally any biodiversity lost in the
construction of High Speed 2. We set up the Natural
Capital Committee to put hard economic numbers on the
value of our environment, and we will extend its life to at
least the end of the next Parliament. We will work with it
to develop a 25 Year Plan to restore the UK’s biodiversity,
and to ensure that both public and private investment in
the environment is directed where we need it most.
We will create a ‘Blue Belt’ to protect precious
marine habitats
Earlier this year, we announced the creation of a new
Marine Protected Area around the Pitcairn Islands – the
largest protected expanse of sea in the world. We will
now go even further, creating a Blue Belt around the
UK’s 14 Overseas Territories, subject to local support and
environmental need. We will designate a further protected
area at Ascension Island, subject to the views of the local
community. And, off our own coasts, we will complete
the network of Marine Conservation Zones that we have
already started, to create a UK Blue Belt of protected sites.
We will protect animal welfare
The quality of the food on your plate, and the economic
security of our farmers, depend on us upholding the
highest standards of animal welfare. We will push for
high animal welfare standards to be incorporated into
international trade agreements and into reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy. We will ban wild animals
in circuses and press for all EU member states to ensure
that animals are only sent to slaughterhouses that
meet high welfare standards. We will encourage other
countries to follow the EU’s lead in banning animal
testing for cosmetics and work to accelerate the global
development and take-up of alternatives to animal
testing where appropriate. We want people to integrate
fully into British society, but that does not mean they
should have to give up the things they hold dear in their
religion. So while we will always make sure the Food
Standards Agency properly regulates the slaughter
of livestock and poultry, we will protect methods of
religious slaughter, such as shechita and halal.
We will tackle international wildlife trade
As hosts of the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife
Trade, we helped secure the adoption of the London
Declaration on Illegal Wildlife Trade and will continue
to lead the world in stopping the poaching that kills
thousands of rhinos, elephants and tigers each year. We
will oppose any resumption of commercial whaling, and
seek further measures at the EU and internationally to
end shark-finning. We will promote effective worldwide
measures for tuna conservation, press for a total ban on
ivory sales, and support the Indian Government in its
efforts to protect the Asian elephant. We will press for
full ‘endangered species’ status for polar bears and a ban
on the international trade in polar bear skins, as well as
for greater attention to be paid to the impact of climate
change on wildlife and habitats in Polar Regions in the
Arctic Council and other international fora.

We want to protect our
environment for future
generations

A record investment in Britain’s
flood defences – over £3 billion


Guaranteeing you clean, affordable and secure energy supplies
Our commitment to you:
Affordable, reliable energy is critical to our economy, to our national security, and to family budgets. We will:
- keep your bills as low as possible and promote competition in the energy market
- ensure your homes and businesses have energy supplies they can rely on
- help you insulate your home
- halt the spread of subsidised onshore wind farms
- meet our climate change commitments, cutting carbon emissions as cheaply as possible, to save you money

Without secure energy supplies, we leave British families
and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and
gas prices; we increase our dependence on foreign
sources of energy; and we become less safe and less
prosperous as a result.
National energy policy demands a willingness to take
decisions today for the good of tomorrow. But Labour
took the opposite approach. Power margins – the safety
cushion we need to prevent blackouts – have fallen to
record lows because of their historic failure to invest
in new capacity. Domestic sources of oil and gas were
unexploited. And Labour failed to deliver the next
generation of energy projects that will help us keep the
lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissions.
All this hurt consumers. The number of major energy
suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the
average gas bill more than doubling.
We have taken a different approach. Where Labour
was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent,
affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years,
but for the coming decades.
Our long-term plan has unlocked £59 billion of
investment in electricity. All parts of the UK will soon
be helping to deliver secure, affordable and low-carbon
energy, from the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, to
offshore wind turbine manufacturing at the new Green
Port in Hull, the next generation of pipelines West of
Shetland and the Swansea tidal lagoon. Our tax cuts
have encouraged record levels of investment in existing
North Sea gas, and the birth of a new industry, shale
gas, which could create many thousands of jobs.
And we have delivered a better deal for consumers too.
We have demanded that energy companies simplify
their tariffs; encouraged more independent suppliers –
which now account for ten per cent of the household
market; and made it much easier for people to switch
energy providers.
But the job is only half done. We need a Conservative
Government to see through this long-term plan
and secure clean but affordable energy supplies for
generations to come. This means a significant expansion
in new nuclear and gas; backing good-value green
energy; and pushing for more new investment in UK
energy sources. Healthy competition, not short-termist

Without secure energy
supplies our country
becomes less safe and less
prosperous


political intervention, is the best way to secure a good
deal for consumers. So we will keep on relentlessly
pushing for more competition to keep bills low.
This is a long-term plan to keep the lights on; keep our
homes warm; and keep families from endless worry
about their energy bills.
Our plan of action:
We will promote competition to keep your
bills as low as possible
We have helped increase the number of independent
energy suppliers from seven to 21, made it easier for
customers to switch to better deals, slashed the number
of tariffs to just 4 per supplier, and cut switching times
in half. We will go even further, implementing the
recommendations of the Competition and Markets
Authority investigation that we triggered. We will ensure
that every home and business in the country has a Smart
Meter by 2020, delivered as cost-effectively as possible,
so consumers have instant, accurate bills and can switch
to an alternative provider within one day. And we will
support low-cost measures on energy efficiency, with the
goal of insulating a million more homes over the next five
years, supporting our commitment to tackle fuel poverty.
We will secure your energy supplies
We will continue to support the safe development of
shale gas, and ensure that local communities share the
proceeds through generous community benefit packages.
We will create a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the North
of England, so that the shale gas resources of the North
are used to invest in the future of the North. We will
continue to support development of North Sea oil and
gas. We will provide start-up funding for promising new
renewable technologies and research, but will only give
significant support to those that clearly represent value
for money.
We will halt the spread of onshore windfarms
Onshore wind now makes a meaningful contribution
to our energy mix and has been part of the necessary
increase in renewable capacity. Onshore windfarms
often fail to win public support, however, and are unable
by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable
energy system requires. As a result, we will end any new
public subsidy for them and change the law so that local
people have the final say on windfarm applications.
We will protect our planet for our children
We have been the greenest government ever, setting
up the world’s first Green Investment Bank, signing a
deal to build the first new nuclear plant in a generation,
trebling renewable energy generation to 19 per cent,
bringing energy efficiency measures to over one million
homes, and committing £1 billion for carbon capture
and storage. We are the largest offshore wind market
in the world. We will push for a strong global climate
deal later this year – one that keeps the goal of limiting
global warming to two-degrees firmly in reach. At
home, we will continue to support the UK Climate
Change Act. We will cut emissions as cost-effectively as
possible, and will not support additional distorting and
expensive power sector targets.

We want a better deal – and
low bills – for hardworking
families

Under Labour, the average gas
bill more than doubled

Fighting crime and standing up for victims
Our commitment to you:
Your local area should be a safe place to grow up, work, raise a family and retire. We will
- continue to cut crime and make your community safer. We will:
- finish the job of police reform, so you can have more confidence that your local policing
team is working effectively
- toughen sentencing and reform the prison system, so dangerous criminals are kept off your streets
- support victims, so that the most vulnerable in our society get the support they deserve.
- scrap the Human Rights Act and curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights, so that foreign criminals can be more easily deported from Britain.

Crime is down by more than 20 per cent since 2010,
according to the independent Crime Survey, and is at its
lowest point since records began. Lower crime means
fewer robberies, less violence on our streets, fewer lives
ruined, and more people able to feel confident about the
future.
Labour didn’t trust our brilliant policemen and women,
probation staff and prison officers to do their job, but
tried to micromanage every police force from Whitehall,
doing serious damage to officer morale, police discretion
and forces’ performance. And Labour failed to provide
sufficient prison places: tens of thousands of prisoners
were released early, putting the public at risk.
We have made progress in turning around the situation
we inherited, with comprehensive reforms to policing,
rehabilitation and the rights of victims. We have already
increased the proportion of officers working on the
frontline, and cut 4.5 million hours of police paperwork.
We have given Chief Constables a clear mandate to cut
crime, reformed stop and search, established the National
Crime Agency, strengthened the police inspectorate,
made the police more accountable through Police and
Crime Commissioners, increased transparency through
crime maps, and set up the College of Policing to drive
up professional standards.
We have made sure that 45,000 offenders will now receive
supervision and rehabilitation on release from prison,
with providers paid according to the results they achieve
in reducing reoffending. We reformed drug treatment so
that abstinence and full recovery is the goal, instead of the
routine maintenance of people’s addictions with substitute
drugs. And with new laws to crack down on domestic
violence, measures to prevent Female Genital Mutilation
(FGM), the first ever Modern Slavery Act, action to tackle
human trafficking and substantial progress in tackling
online child abuse, we have consistently stood up for the
most vulnerable in our society.
We will carry on making every community safer, even
when resources are tight. We will continue reducing
paperwork, increasing sentence lengths for the most
serious offences, and making sure that prisons are places
of rehabilitation.
We need to complete our revolution in the way we manage
offenders in the community, using the latest technology to
keep criminals on the straight and narrow. And we must
also become smarter when it comes to crime prevention,
dealing with the drivers of crime such as drugs and
alcohol. So we will focus not only on punishment, but also

Crime has been cut by more
than a fifth


on rehabilitating offenders and intervening early to prevent
troubled young people being drawn into crime.
Our plan of action:
We will finish the job of police reform, backing
officers to fight crime unimpeded
We will ensure proper provision of health and community-based
places of safety for people suffering mental health
crises – saving police time and stopping vulnerable people
being detained in police custody. To speed up justice, we
will extend the use of police-led prosecutions. We will allow
police forces to retain a greater percentage of the value
of assets they seize from criminals. We will improve our
response to cyber-crime with reforms to police training and
an expansion in the number of volunteer ‘Cyber Specials’.
We will enable fire and police services to work more
closely together and develop the role of our elected and
accountable Police and Crime Commissioners.
We will transform the relationship between
the police and the public
We have taken action to boost public confidence and trust
in the police and now want to go even further. We will
improve the diversity of police recruitment – especially
of black and ethnic minority officers – by supporting
the development of new direct entry and fast-track
schemes such as Police Now, which offers top graduates
a new route into policing. We will overhaul the police
complaints system. We will use the Police Innovation Fund
to accelerate the adoption of new technologies, including
mobile devices, that will transform the service the public
receives. And we will legislate to mandate changes in police
practices if stop and search does not become more targeted
and stop to arrest ratios do not improve.
We will introduce more effective crime
prevention measures to break the cycle of
offending
We are developing a modern crime prevention strategy
to address the key drivers of crime. We will publish
standards, performance data and a ranking system for
the security of smartphones and tablets, as well as online
financial and retail services. We will overhaul the system
of police cautions, and ensure that offenders always
have conditions, such as victim redress, attached to their
punishment. We will create a blanket ban on all new
psychoactive substances, protecting young people from
exposure to so-called ‘legal highs’. And we will make
sobriety orders available to all courts in England and
Wales, enforced through new alcohol monitoring tags.
We will reform our prison system
Despite making savings in the prison budget, there are
around 3,000 more adult male prison places today than in
2010. We will make further savings by closing old, inefficient
prisons, building larger, modern and fit-for-purpose ones
and expanding payment-by-results. And we will introduce
widespread random testing of drug use in jails, new body
scanners, greater use of mobile phone blocking technology
and a new strategy to tackle corruption in prisons.
We will protect victims and support the
vulnerable
We have already introduced a new Victims’ Code and
taken steps to protect vulnerable witnesses and victims.
Now we will strengthen victims’ rights further, with
a new Victims’ Law that will enshrine key rights for
victims, including the right to make a personal statement
and have it read in court before sentencing – and before
the Parole Board decides on a prisoner's release. We
will give all vulnerable victims and witnesses greater
opportunity to give evidence outside court, and roll out
nationally pre-trial cross examination for child victims.
We will prioritise tackling violence against
women and girls
We have made protecting women and girls from
violence and supporting victims and survivors of
sexual violence a key priority. We will now work with
local authorities, the NHS and Police and Crime
Commissioners to ensure a secure future for specialist
FGM and forced marriage units, refuges and rape
crisis centres. We will ensure that all publicly-funded

There are around 3,000 more
adult male prison places today
than in 2010


advocates have specialist victims' training before
becoming involved in serious sexual offences cases. We
have set up an independant statutory inquiry into child
sexual abuse, and will make sure it can challange
institutions and individuals without fear or favour, and
get to the truth. And we will continue the urgent work
of overhauling how our police, social services and other
agencies work together to protect vulnerable children,
especially from the kind of organised grooming and
sexual exploitation that has come to light in Rotherham,
and other towns and cities across the UK.
We will toughen sentencing and use new
technology to protect the public
We will continue to reform the way we rehabilitate
prisoners. We will deploy new technology to monitor
offenders in the community and to bring persistent
offenders to justice more quickly. A new semi-custodial
sentence will be introduced for prolific criminals, allowing
for a short, sharp spell in custody to change behaviour.
To tackle those cases where judges get it wrong, we will
extend the scope of the Unduly Lenient Scheme, so a
wider range of sentences can be challenged. We will
review the legislation governing hate crimes, including the
case for extending the scope of the law to cover crimes
committed against people on the basis of disability, sexual
orientation or transgender identity. We will improve
the treatment of women offenders, exploring how new
technology may enable more women with young children
to serve their sentence in the community.
We will reform human rights law and our
legal system
We have stopped prisoners from having the vote, and
have deported suspected terrorists such as Abu Qatada,
despite all the problems created by Labour’s human rights
laws. The next Conservative Government will scrap the
Human Rights Act, and introduce a British Bill of Rights.
This will break the formal link between British courts and
the European Court of Human Rights, and make our
own Supreme Court the ultimate arbiter of human rights
matters in the UK. We will continue the £375 million
modernisation of our courts system, reducing delay and
frustration for the public. And we will continue to review
our legal aid systems, so they can continue to provide
access to justice in an efficient way.

We will scrap the Human
Rights Act and introduce a
British Bill of Rights


Preventing terrorism, countering extremism
Our commitment to you:
Keeping you and your family safe is our overriding priority. The threat of extremism and
terrorism remains serious, but with our tough, intelligent and comprehensive approach, we will
confront and ultimately defeat it. We will:
- strengthen the ability of the police and intelligence agencies to disrupt terrorist plots,
so the authorities have all the tools they need to prevent attacks
- deal with online radicalisation and propaganda, so we can reduce the risk of young
people being drawn into extremism and terrorism
- tackle all forms of extremism, including non-violent extremism, so our values and our way of life are properly promoted and defended

The first duty of government is to keep you safe. We
will always do whatever is necessary to protect the
British people. We have protected and increased the
budgets for the security and intelligence agencies and
counter-terrorism policing. But the scale of the threat
to our country from a number of terrorist groups
remains serious, and the rise of ISIL in Syria and Iraq
has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks
against Britain can be planned, financed and directed.
However, the nature of the threat we face is making
it more difficult for the security services to identify
terrorist plots – especially thanks to new technology. We
must always ensure our outstanding intelligence and
security agencies have the powers they need to keep
us safe. At the same time, we continue to reject any
suggestions of sweeping, authoritarian measures that
would threaten our hard-won freedoms. In the last year
alone, we have given the authorities greater powers to
disrupt and control the movements of people who want
to travel abroad to fight, including strengthening powers
to confiscate the passports of those seeking to travel to
commit terrorism.
The next Conservative Government will continue to
take a tough, intelligent and comprehensive approach
to preventing terrorism and confronting extremism.
We will update our counter-terrorism laws wherever
necessary to make sure they properly reflect the threats
we face.
Dealing with these threats is not just about new powers.
It is about how we combat extremism in all its forms.
We need to tackle it at root, before it takes the form
of violence and terror. At the heart of our approach
lies an uncompromising defence of British values,
and a very simple message: in Britain, you do not just
enjoy the freedom to live how you choose; you have a
responsibility to respect others too.
Our plan of action:
We will strengthen counter-terrorism powers
We have strengthened counter-terrorism laws, including
making it easier to stop British nationals travelling

We will always do whatever
is necessary to protect the
British people

Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada
removed from this country once
and for all


Over 75,000 pieces of unlawful
material have been taken down
from the internet

abroad to fight, and control the return of those who
do. We will keep up to date the ability of the police and
security services to access communications data – the
‘who, where, when and how’ of a communication,
but not its content. Our new communications data
legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist
plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming
gangs, even as technology develops. We will maintain
the ability of the authorities to intercept the content
of suspects’ communications, while continuing to
strengthen oversight of the use of these powers.
We will confront all forms of extremism,
including non-violent extremism
We have already reformed the Prevent strategy so that
it focuses on non-violent as well as violent extremism.
We will now go even further. We will outlaw groups
that foment hate with the introduction of new Banning
Orders for extremist organisations. These could be
applied to dangerous organisations that fall short
of the existing thresholds for proscription under
terrorism legislation. To restrict the harmful activities
of extremist individuals, we will create new Extremism
Disruption Orders. These new powers might, for
instance, prevent those who are seeking to radicalise
young British people online from using the internet
or communicating via social media. We will develop a
strategy to tackle the infiltration of extremists into our
schools and public services. We will strengthen Ofcom’s
role so that tough measures can be taken against
channels that broadcast extremist content.
We will enable employers to check whether an
individual is an extremist and bar them from working
with children. And we will take further measures
to ensure colleges and universities do not give a
platform to extremist speakers.


- DIGNITY IN YOUR RETIREMENT
Dignity in your retirement
Our commitment to you:
If you have worked hard during your life, saved, paid your taxes and done the right thing, you
deserve dignity and security when you retire. We want Britain to be the best country in which to
grow old. We will:
- take the family home out of Inheritance Tax for all but the richest by raising the effective
threshold for married couples and civil partners to £1 million
- continue to increase the State Pension through our triple lock, so it rises by at least 2.5 per
cent, inflation or earnings, whichever is highest
- reward saving by introducing a new single-tier pension
- give you the freedom to invest and spend your pension however you like – and let you pass it on to your loved ones tax-free
- protect pensioner benefits including the free bus pass, TV licences and Winter Fuel Payment
- ensure Britain has a strong economy, so we can continue to protect the NHS and make sure
no-one is forced to sell their home to pay for care.

Our pensioners have made this country what it is, and we
believe that, in return, younger generations owe it to them
to ensure they have dignity and security in their old age.
In office, Labour neglected the elderly. They raided
pensions with a £150 billion stealth tax. One year they
increased pensions by a paltry 75 pence. And they
did nothing to give people control over their savings
and pensions, or to stop them from having to sell their
homes to pay for care. In place of these meagre pension
increases, we have introduced the triple lock: the Basic
State Pension will now always rise in line with whichever
is higher – earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Since
2010, we have seen the Basic Pension has risen in value
by £950. We have abolished the Default Retirement
Age, so you can keep working as long as you like. We
are replacing the Pension Credit – basically a means
test – with a new Single-Tier Pension: whatever people
save, they will keep. And we have introduced a cap
on residential social care costs: no one will have to sell
their home to pay for care. On top of all this, we have
scrapped compulsory annuities, giving people complete
control over their pension pots; kept all pensioner
benefits; and protected NHS spending.
In the next five years, as our country recovers and
our elderly population grows, we will continue to put
pensioners at the heart of our long-term economic plan.
Our plan of action:
We will look after you as you grow older
We will cap charges for residential social care
from April 2016 and also allow deferred payment
agreements, so no one has to sell their home. For the
first time, individual liabilities will be limited, giving
everyone the peace of mind that they will receive
the care they need, and that they will be protected
from unlimited costs if they develop very serious care

We are building a Britain
where everyone who has
worked hard and done the
right thing can enjoy security
in retirement


needs – such as dementia. We will protect the NHS
budget and we will prioritise funding for dementia
research.
We will guarantee your financial security as
you grow older
We will keep the triple lock pension system. From April
2016 we are bringing in a Single Tier Pension; this will
effectively abolish means-testing the pensions of people
who have contributed all their lives. We will maintain
all the current pensioner benefits including Winter Fuel
Payments, free bus passes, free prescriptions and TV
licences for the next Parliament, while implementing
the ""temperature test"" for Winter Fuel Payment, so that
expats in hot countries no longer receive it. And we will
allow pensioners to access their pension savings and
decide whether or not to take out an annuity, so they can
make their own decisions about their money.
We will help you support your loved-ones
We have guaranteed that ISAs can now be passed on to a
spouse tax-free, so that from this April they are no longer
subject to Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. We have
abolished the 55 per cent tax on pension pots, so that
when the deceased is 75 or over any beneficiary only has
to pay their marginal Income Tax rate – normally 20 per
cent – when they draw down the pension. And we have
enabled anyone who dies before the age of 75 to pass on
their pension pot completely tax-free, so that beneficiaries
will pay no tax on pensions they inherit or on the income
they draw down. And we will take the family home out
of tax for all but the richest by increasing the effective
Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil
partners to £1 million, with a new transferable main
residence allowance of £175,000 per person. This
will be paid for by reducing the tax relief on pension
contributions for people earning more than £150,000.

We will continue to increase the
Basic State Pension through our
‘triple lock’ guarantee

It’s your money, you worked
hard for it – and you should
be able to pass it onto your
loved-ones


- KEEPING OUR COUNTRY SECURE
Stronger together: a Union for the 21st century
Our commitment to you:
Wherever you live in the great nations of our United Kingdom, we are on your side. We will:
- give English MPs a veto over matters only affecting England, including on Income Tax
honour in full our commitments to Scotland to devolve extensive new powers
- implement the agreed settlement for Wales, handing over more responsibility to the Welsh Assembly
- continue to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is strong.

England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – ours
is the greatest union of nations the world has ever seen.
Together we have done so much, and we can do much
more. The Conservative Party is the party of the Union
– and we will always do our utmost to keep our family
of nations together.
It was right to create the Scottish Parliament and Welsh
Assembly, but the job was not finished. Without the
ability to raise money, the devolved Parliaments were not
accountable to taxpayers. Without devolution to local
councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever.
And one fundamental unfairness remains today: Scottish
MPs are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that
only affected England and Wales, while English and
Welsh MPs cannot vote on matters that only affect
Scotland. This leaves a space for resentment to fester –
and put our Union in jeopardy.
We have tackled the problems we inherited. First, we
held the referendum on Scottish independence. It was
the right thing to do, and the question of Scotland’s
place in the United Kingdom is now settled. We have
made the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly
responsible for funding more of what they spend. We
have agreed with Northern Ireland’s parties a deal to
help ensure that politics works, the economy grows and
society is more cohesive and united. And we have set out
clear plans for English votes for English laws.
All this reflects a core Conservative belief: power to the
people. Around Britain you can see that principle in practice.
In town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public
spending. In communities, local people have the right to
vote in referendums on council tax rises. Neighbourhoods
are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to
assets such as parks and public buildings.
Our commitment to the Union means we want to
strengthen it. We will let local people have more say on
local planning and let them vote on local issues. We will
not let anyone impose artificial regions on England –
our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are
here to stay. We will continue devolution settlements
for Scotland and Wales, and implement the Stormont
House Agreement in Northern Ireland. And we will give
English MPs a veto over English-only matters, including
on Income Tax – answering the West Lothian Question.
In the last five years, we have proven that we are the
party of the Union. We will go further in the next
Parliament, pushing power out beyond Westminster,
Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, so we keep our
United Kingdom strong and secure for the long term.

We believe in giving power
to hardworking taxpayers,
letting you decide on the
issues that affect you and
your family


Our plan of action:
We will build an enduring settlement for the
United Kingdom
We will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to
the people of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland. We will strengthen and improve devolution
for each part of our United Kingdom in a way that
accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: we will
implement the Smith Commission and St David’s Day
Agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the UK,
including English votes for English laws.
We will give English MPs a veto over matters
only affecting England
We will maintain the Westminster Parliament as the UK
and England’s law-making body. But we want Parliament
to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting England,
or England and Wales, can only be taken with the consent
of the majority of MPs representing constituencies in
England, or in England and Wales. We will end the manifest
unfairness whereby Scotland is able to decide its own laws in
devolved areas, only for Scottish MPs also to be able to have
the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only
England and Wales. We will maintain the integrity of the
UK Parliament by ensuring that MPs from all parts of the
UK continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set
overall spending levels. But we will:
- change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of
legislation affecting only England or England and Wales
will be considered by a Committee drawn in proportion
to party strength in England or England and Wales.
- add a new stage to how English legislation is
passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to
England would be able to pass to its Third Reading
and become law without being approved through a
legislative consent motion by a Grand Committee
made up of all English MPs, or all English and
Welsh MPs.
- extend the principle of English consent to financial
matters such as how spending is distributed within
England and to taxation – including an English rate
of Income Tax – when the equivalent decisions have
been devolved to Scotland.
We will honour in full our commitments to
Scotland
A new Scotland Bill will be in our first Queen’s Speech and
will be introduced in the first session of a new Parliament.
We will implement the recommendations of the Smith
Commission so that more than 50 per cent of the Scottish
Parliament’s budget will be funded from revenues raised in
Scotland and it will have significant new welfare powers to
complement existing devolved powers in health and social
care. We will provide the Scottish Parliament with one of
the most extensive packages of tax and spending powers
of any devolved legislature in the world. We will retain the
Barnett Formula as the basis for determining the grant
to cover that part of the Scottish Parliament’s budget not
funded by tax revenues raised in Scotland. We will agree
new rules with the Scottish Government for how the block
grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved
tax and welfare powers. And we will ensure that where
responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes
only affect public spending in that part of the country.
We will implement Wales’ devolution
settlement
We will clarify the division of powers between Wales
and the UK Government. We will:
- devolve to the Welsh Assembly control over its own
affairs – including the Assembly name, size and
electoral system, Assembly elections and voting age.
- implement other recommendations of the second
Silk Report where there is all-party support as set
out in the St David’s Day Agreement; this will
include devolving to the Welsh Assembly important
economic powers over ports and energy consents.
- introduce a new Wales Bill if these changes require
legislation.
- continue to reserve policing and justice as matters for
the UK Parliament.
- introduce a ‘funding floor’ to protect Welsh relative
funding and provide certainty for the Welsh Government
to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on
Income Tax powers in the next Parliament.


- make the Welsh Government responsible for raising
more of the money it spends so the Welsh people
can hold their politicians to account.
We will continue to build a Northern Ireland
where politics works, the economy grows and
society is strong
We will maintain Northern Ireland’s position within
the United Kingdom on the basis of the consent of its
people. Our strong support for the political institutions
established over the past two decades as a result of the
various Agreements will continue. We will:
- put the safety and security of the people of Northern
Ireland as our highest priority. We will develop and
implement our strategy to combat terrorism, giving
the strongest possible support to the brave men and
women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
- work to implement fully and faithfully the historic
Stormont House Agreement to enable devolution to
function more effectively; to deal with the legacy of
the past; and to make progress on divisive issues such
as flags and parading.
- continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland
Executive to implement commitments in the 2013
economic pact to rebalance the economy and to
build a more united and stronger society.
- complete the devolution of Corporation Tax powers
to the Assembly, consistent with the Executive
fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform
and efficiencies in the Stormont House Agreement.


Real change in our relationship with the European Union
Our commitment to you:
For too long, your voice has been ignored on Europe. We will:
- give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the EU, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017
- commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the Eurozone
- reform the workings of the EU, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic
- reclaim power from Brussels on your behalf and safeguard British interests in the Single
Market
- back businesses to create jobs in Britain by completing ambitious trade deals and reducing red tape.

The EU needs to change. And it is time for the British
people – not politicians – to have their say. Only the
Conservative Party will deliver real change and real choice
on Europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017.
Labour failed to give you a choice on the EU. They
handed over major new powers to Brussels without
your consent, and gave away £7 billion of the British
rebate. We have taken action in Europe to promote your
economic security. We cut the EU budget for the first
time ever, saving British taxpayers £8.15 billion. We took
Britain out of Eurozone bailouts, including for Greece –
the first ever return of powers from Brussels. Our Prime
Minister vetoed a new EU treaty that would have damaged
Britain’s interests. And we have pursued a bold, positive,
pro-business agenda, exempting smallest businesses from
red tape, promoting free trade, and pushing to extend the
Single Market to new sectors, like digital.
But there is much more to do. The EU is too bureaucratic
and too undemocratic. It interferes too much in our
daily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new
members joining in recent years has had a real impact on
local communities. We are clear about what we want from
Europe. We say: yes to the Single Market. Yes to turbocharging
free trade. Yes to working together where we are
stronger together than alone. Yes to a family of nation
states, all part of a European Union – but whose interests,
crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the Euro or out.
No to ‘ever closer union.’ No to a constant flow of power
to Brussels. No to unnecessary interference. And no, of
course, to the Euro, to participation in Eurozone bail-outs
or notions like a European Army.
It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative
Government that membership of the European Union
depends on the consent of the British people – and in
recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin. That’s why,
after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for
Britain in Europe, and then ask the British people whether
they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave.
David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a
government that offers an in-out referendum. We will hold
that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect
the outcome.
So the choice at this election is clear: Labour and the

We believe in letting the
people decide: so we will hold
an in-out referendum on our
membership of the EU before
the end of 2017


Liberal Democrats won’t give you a say over the EU.
UKIP can’t give you a say. Only the Conservative
Party will deliver real change in Europe – and only the
Conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendum.
Our plan of action:
We will let you decide whether to stay in
or leave the EU
We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament
for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain’s
membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will
negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then
we will ask the British people whether they want to stay
in on this basis, or leave. We will honour the result of the
referendum, whatever the outcome.
We will protect Britain's economy
We will protect our economy from any further integration
of the Eurozone. The integration of the Eurozone has
raised acute questions for non-Eurozone countries like the
United Kingdom. We benefit from the Single Market and
do not want to stand in the way of the Eurozone resolving
its difficulties. Indeed, given the trade between Britain and
the Eurozone countries we want to see these economies
returning to growth. But we will not let the integration of
the Eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the Single Market
or in any way disadvantage the UK.
We will reclaim powers from Brussels
We want to see powers flowing away from Brussels, not
to it. We have already taken action to return around 100
powers, but we want to go further. We want national
parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted
European legislation. And we want an end to our
commitment to an ‘ever closer union,’ as enshrined in
the Treaty to which every EU country has to sign up.
Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence
policy remains firmly under British national control,
maintaining NATO and the transatlantic relationship as
the cornerstones of our defence and security policy.
We will scrap the Human Rights Act
We will scrap Labour's Human Rights Act and introduce
a British Bill of Rights which will restore common sense
to the application of human rights in the UK. The Bill
will remain faithful to the basic principles of human
rights, which we signed up to in the original European
Convention on Human Rights. It will protect basic rights,
like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are
an essential part of a modern democratic society. But it will
reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law
being used for more and more purposes, and often with
little regard for the rights of wider society. Among other
things the Bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign
criminals who pose a threat to our society from using
spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportation.
We will take action in Europe to make
you better off
We want an EU that helps Britain move ahead, not
one that holds us back. We have already succeeded
in exempting our smallest businesses from new EU
regulations, and kicked-off negotiations for a massive
EU trade deal with the USA, which could be worth
billions of pounds to the UK economy. We will build
on this. We want to preserve the integrity of the Single
Market, by insisting on protections for those countries
that have kept their own currencies. We want to expand
the Single Market, breaking down the remaining barriers
to trade and ensuring that new sectors are opened
up to British firms. We want to ensure that new rules
target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services
industry, while safeguarding Britain as a global centre of
excellence in finance. So we will resist EU attempts to
restrict legitimate financial services activities. We will press
for lower EU spending, further reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy and Structural Funds, and for EU
money to be focused on promoting jobs and growth.

David Cameron vetoed a new EU
Treaty that would have damaged
Britain’s interests – the first time
in history that a British Prime
Minister has done so



A Britain standing tall in the world
Our commitment to you:
Everything we do around the world will be driven by a determination to protect your security
and help you prosper. We will:
- ensure Britain is a major player on the world stage, using diplomacy to protect your
interests, uphold British values and tackle threats to your security and prosperity
- help generate new trade, investment and job opportunities, to benefit you and your family
- maintain our world class Armed Forces so they continue to guarantee your security
- uphold our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international development.

Economic security and national security are two sides
of the same coin. Without one, you cannot have the
other. Our prosperity depends upon Britain remaining
an active, outward-looking nation, one that is engaged
with the world, not looking in on itself. We will maintain
Britain’s strong global role and our capacity to project
British power and values around the world.
Labour’s Great Recession weakened Britain on the
world stage. They left a £38 billion black hole in the
defence budget, went 12 years without conducting
a Strategic Defence Review, and, at times, failed to
provide our Armed Forces with the equipment they
needed in Afghanistan. They shut down over 30
British diplomatic missions, failed to plan properly for
Iraq’s reconstruction, ignored trade and investment
opportunities overseas, and neglected vital relationships.
We have strengthened Britain’s influence in the world. The
National Security Council that we established ensures proper,
strategic decision-making at the top of government. We have
boosted exports to emerging markets, opened new diplomatic
posts in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and led the world
in promoting women’s rights and tackling sexual violence in
conflict. We have balanced the defence budget and set out a
clear strategy to defend our nation for the long term.
We and our allies face major challenges: Islamist
extremism, an aggressive Russia, economic uncertainty
in the Eurozone, nuclear proliferation and infectious
diseases. A Conservative Government will tackle these
challenges. We will use our membership of NATO, the
EU, the Commonwealth, our UN Security Council seat,
our Special Relationship with the USA, our intelligence
agencies, vital institutions like the BBC World Service
and British Council, and the strong personal links
between our diaspora communities and other countries,
to achieve the best for Britain.
We will back this up with UK military power and
international aid. Our long-term economic plan will
ensure we have the economic strength to maintain
our world-class Armed Forces, to uphold our national
security and project power globally. Aid helps prevent
failed states from becoming havens for terrorists.
It builds long-term markets for our businesses, by
promoting global prosperity, and reduces migration
pressures. So we will maintain our commitment to
tackling conflict, poverty and disease around the world.

We want a strong, secure
and stable country

Only with a strong economy
can we maintain our world-class
Armed Forces and
protect our national security


Our plan of action:
We will keep you secure
We will tackle global terrorism and the poisonous
ideology of Islamist extremism while taking a patient,
long-term approach to preventing conflict and state
failure. We will work with our partners to address threats
to UK security, including the spread of nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons, pandemic diseases, the illegal
drugs trade, piracy and organised crime. We will:
- work for peace, stability and an inclusive settlement
in Syria and Iraq; and pursue a comprehensive
political and military strategy to defeat ISIL
- uphold the sovereignty, integrity and capacity of
Ukraine, and continue to reject Russia’s illegal
annexation of Crimea
- stand shoulder to shoulder with our NATO allies,
reassuring all its members – especially those closest
to Russia – of their security, and continue to support
the Euro-Atlantic path for Western Balkan nations
- ensure that the significant achievements of our
Armed Forces in Afghanistan are maintained; and
support the Government of Afghanistan in ensuring
that the country remains stable and never again
becomes a haven for international terrorists
- support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, robustly defending the right of Israel to
protect its security, while continuing to condemn
illegal settlement building, which undermines the
prospects for peace
- protect global security by helping to lead
international efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining
a nuclear weapon; and work to ensure that North
Korea ends its development of nuclear weapons.
We will help make you better off
Over the last five years, we have used foreign policy to
boost our prosperity. UK exports to China have more
than doubled since 2009.We will do more, using the new
embassies and diplomatic posts we have opened to connect
Britain to the fastest-growing economies in the world. We
will push for freer global trade, concluding major trade deals
with the US, India and Japan and reinvigorating the World
Trade Organisation. As part of our drive to attract more
investment into the UK and increase British exports, we will:
build on our strong relationship with India, push
for an ambitious EU-India trade deal and support
India’s bid for permanent representation on the UN
Security Council
strengthen our economic links with China, doubling
support for British firms selling goods there and
championing an EU-China trade deal.
We will stand up for British values
Our long-term security and prosperity depend on a
stable international system that upholds our values.
Over the last five years, we have stood up for what we
believe in: intervening to stop a massacre in Libya,
leading the world in tackling sexual violence in conflict,
and helping women and children who have fled violence
in Syria. We will continue this leadership. We will
stand up for the freedom of people of all religions –
and non-religious people – to practise their beliefs in
peace and safety, for example by supporting persecuted
Christians in the Middle East. We will strengthen the
Commonwealth’s focus on promoting democratic values
and development. We will drive forward the Preventing
Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative. We will support
global processes on arms control. And we will continue
to support universal human rights. We will:
- uphold our Special Relationship with the USA
and further strengthen our ties with our close


Commonwealth allies, Australia, Canada and New
Zealand
- uphold the democratic rights of the people of
Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands to remain British,
for as long as that is their wish, and protect our
Overseas Territories
- stand up for the rule of law and human rights in
Zimbabwe
- support a democratic transition in Burma
- promote reconciliation and human rights in Sri
Lanka, including through supporting the UN
investigation into war crimes, which the Prime
Minister was instrumental in securing following his
historic visit to Jaffna
- actively support Cypriots to find a peaceful and
lasting settlement to reunite their island.

Keeping Britain safe
Our plan of action:
We will protect our nation
We will continue to keep our Armed Forces strong so they
can continue to keep you safe. We will maintain the size
of the regular armed services and not reduce the army
to below 82,000. We will retain the Trident continuous at
sea nuclear deterrent to provide the ultimate guarantee
of our safety and build the new fleet of four Successor
Ballistic Missile Submarines – securing thousands of
highly-skilled engineering jobs in the UK. We will work
closely with our allies to continue to strengthen NATO
– supporting its new multi-national rapid response force.
We will maintain our global presence, strengthening our
defence partnerships in the Gulf and Asia. Later this year,
we will hold a National Security Strategy and Strategic
Defence and Security Review to plan for the future.
We will maintain a balanced defence budget
and give our Armed Forces the equipment
they need
We can only have strong, well-funded Armed Forces by
continuing to build a stronger economy. We have the second
largest defence budget in NATO and the largest in the EU.
We are meeting NATO’s two targets: that each country
should spend two per cent of its gross national income on
defence, and of that spending 20 per cent should go on
major equipment. We have made commitments for the
equipment plan to be funded at one per cent above inflation
for the next Parliament. We plan to invest at least £160
billion in new military equipment over the next decade: as
well as our six new Type 45 destroyers, we are building a
class of seven Astute submarines and buying the Joint Strike
Fighter, Scout armoured vehicles, Type 26 frigates and
new Apache attack helicopters. We will bring both of our
new Aircraft Carriers – HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS
Prince of Wales, the largest vessels the Royal Navy has ever
possessed – into service, so we have one available for use at
all times. We will continue to seek value for money in defence
procurement, recognising the important contribution that
the UK defence industry makes to our prosperity.
We will maintain strong, modern Armed Forces
Modern, flexible Armed Forces need strong reserve capacity,
alongside strong regular forces. We have invested significantly
in our reserves, and we will deliver on our commitment
to expand them to 35,000. We will continue to invest in
our cyber defence capabilities. We will also provide more
opportunities for talented people from all communities and
walks of life to serve their country. We will ensure our Armed
Forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights
claims that undermine their ability to do their job.

We have the biggest defence
budget in the EU – and the
second biggest in NATO

We will do all we can to honour
those who give so much



We will continue to honour the Armed Forces
Covenant
We have honoured our commitment to enshrine the
Armed Forces Covenant in law and done much to
support our servicemen and women. We have delivered
better accommodation for service families, helped
service personnel buy their own home, and ensured that
children of members of the Armed Forces benefit from
the Pupil Premium. We have delivered proper mental
health support and priority access to medical treatments
for veterans. To ensure that those who serve can enjoy
greater economic security, we have boosted allowances
and tax reliefs. We have protected pensions for our
servicemen and women. We have ensured that injured
service personnel have access to the latest prosthetics and
world-class rehabilitation facilities. And we have used
£450 million of LIBOR fines from banks to support the
Armed Forces community. The money has been used
to support a wide range of charities and good causes,
from providing better play facilities for the children of
service families, to helping rehabilitation through sport for
injured veterans. We pressed for the introduction of the
Arctic Star medal – for veterans of the Arctic Convoys
– and the Bomber Command Clasp, to ensure proper
recognition for those who risked their lives to keep us free.
We will build on this proud record, implementing Lord
Ashcroft’s recommendations on the way the nation fulfils
its obligations to veterans. We will work to address hearing
loss among veterans. And we will continue to support
the unsung heroes of the Armed Forces community: the
partners and families of those who serve.

Tackling global challenges to make you safer and more prosperous
Our plan of action:
We will continue to honour our commitments
Tackling global poverty is both the right thing to do
and in Britain’s interests. We have delivered on our
promises to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 per
cent of national income as aid and to enshrine this in
law. We will continue to meet the 0.7 per cent target,
maintain an independent Department for International
Development and keep aid untied. Our aid budget
meets the OECD aid rules, and we will actively engage
in international discussions to ensure that these rules
fully reflect the importance of peace, stability and
effective institutions for reducing poverty. We will insist
that every government and organisation we fund meets
global transparency standards.
We will save lives
By 2020, we will save 1.4 million children’s lives, by
immunising 76 million children against killer diseases.
We will help at least 11 million children in the poorest
countries gain a decent education, improve nutrition
for at least 50 million people, who would otherwise go
hungry; and help at least 60 million people get access
to clean water and sanitation, to stop terrible diseases.
We will continue to lead the response to humanitarian
emergencies, and establish a means to respond rapidly
to crises. Our leading role in dealing with the recent
outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is a good example
of how our aid programme helps protect Britain from
serious threats, while also helping countries tackle major
emergencies which put their stability at risk. We will
lead a major new global programme to accelerate the
development of vaccines and drugs to eliminate the
world’s deadliest infectious diseases, while investing to
save lives from malaria and working to end preventable
child and maternal deaths. We will expand payment by
results and ensure all money to governments is clearly
earmarked for specific purposes.
We will tackle the causes of poverty and
promote gender equality
We will push for new global goals to eradicate extreme
poverty by 2030 and promote human development,

By 2020, we will save 1.4
million children's lives


gender equality and good governance. We will work
to prevent climate change and assist the poorest in
adapting to it. As the route out of poverty is about
much more than just aid, we will boost growth and
jobs, making it easier for people to start up businesses
and trade freely with each other. We will continue to
promote the golden thread of democracy, the rule of
law, property rights, a free media and open, accountable
institutions. We will promote girls’ education, encourage
equal access to property rights and work to achieve
access to family planning for everyone who wants it. We
will continue to lead efforts to tackle violence against
women and girls, end FGM and combat early and
forced marriage, both at home and abroad.
We will help you fight poverty
Our International Citizen Service has given thousands
of young Brits the opportunity to volunteer abroad. We
will triple it in size. We will also double our successful
Aid Match scheme, which matches donations to
charity from the aid budget. We will boost partnerships
between UK institutions and their counterparts in the
developing world, and help people in the UK give or
lend money directly to individuals and entrepreneurs
around the world.


Conclusion
SO THIS IS OUR DETAILED PLAN FOR BRITAIN.
Our plan to entrench the progress of the past five years. Our plan for you and your
family, at every stage of your life.
IT IS UNDERPINNED BY SOME SIMPLE CONSERVATIVE VALUES.
Those who work hard and do the right thing must be rewarded. Everyone should
be able to rise as high as their talents and effort will take them. We measure
our success not just in how we show our strength abroad, but in how we care for
the weakest and most vulnerable at home.
ABOVE ALL, RUNNING THROUGH THIS PLAN
IS A TRUE BELIEF IN BRITAIN.
In the past five years, as so often before in our history, we have once again
defied the expectations of the world to rise up and meet our challenges. The British
character is renewed every day by the millions who work hard, raise their families, care for
those who need help, who do the right thing – and make this country what it is.
THIS MANIFESTO IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE LIVES
OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.
Together we have come so far. If we stick to our long-term plan, we can secure
a better future for you and your family. So let us keep moving forward; and set our sights
on making our great country greater still.

The Labour Party Manifesto 2015

Britain only succeeds
when working people
succeed. This is a plan
to reward hard work,
share prosperity and
build a better Britain.

Labour’s Manifesto Budget Responsibility Lock
Our manifesto begins with the Budget Responsibility Lock we offer the British
people. It is the basis for all our plans in this manifesto because it is by securing
our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the
working people of Britain.
The Budget Responsibility Lock guarantees that:
Every policy in this manifesto is paid for. Not one commitment requires
additional borrowing. We are the first party to make that pledge and with
this manifesto it is delivered. We will legislate to require all major parties to
have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the Office for
Budget Responsibility.
A Labour government will cut the deficit every year. The first line of Labour’s
first Budget will be: “This Budget cuts the deficit every year”. This manifesto
sets out that we will only lay a Budget before the House of Commons that
cuts the deficit every year, which the OBR will independently verify.
We will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon
as possible in the next parliament. This manifesto sets out that we will not
compromise on this commitment.


Foreword
We are a great country. With great people. In the last five years I have heard your
stories, your hopes and your dreams. And I have heard too your frustrations.
The countless people working as hard as they possibly can and still struggling to
pay the bills. The young people with great ambitions but great anxieties about
the future. The dedicated staff of our NHS, who are deeply concerned about
its future. And all those who have served our country, are now retired, and ask
where our country is going.
This manifesto is inspired by you.
I take a simple view. We are a great country, but we can be even better
The fundamental truth that runs through this manifesto is that Britain will only
succeed when working people succeed. It is an idea at the heart of my beliefs.
And it drives our better plan for a better future.
It means a country where hard work is rewarded, with high skill, high wage jobs.
An economy built on strong and secure foundations, where we balance the books.
It means building a future for all our young people, so they can get world-class
apprenticeships and access to affordable, higher education. It means strong
public services, rescuing our NHS.
It means strong communities, where power is shared by people in every part of
the country and where we respond to people’s concerns about immigration, with
proper controls.
It means a Britain where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the
very top of our society. And it means an outward looking country, engaged in the
world for our national interest.
For me, the privilege of serving as Prime Minister in our country would be for one
purpose alone: to work every day to help build a country that works again for
working people. This manifesto is our plan to achieve that goal.
Ed Miliband


We will build a better future for Britain
Britain is a great country ready to build a better future.
This manifesto sets out Labour’s plan for national renewal.
The British people, are known for tolerance, responsibility to others and for
our belief in the value of hard work. We look confidently outward to the world.
These are great British traditions - things we all believe in, things our country is
good at. We are at our best when we work together. We see this every day in
our workplaces, in our families, and in our communities. People want to get on,
they want to give their children a better future, and they want to help to change
Britain for the better.
But across Britain working people also know a simple truth: the economy is not
working for them. For years now, our economy has not rewarded everyone who
put in a good, honest day’s work. However hard people work, many don’t earn
enough to make ends meet. Too many have been driven from secure, full-time
work, into precarious, badly paid jobs – many working on zero-hours contracts.
Time to enjoy friends and family is increasingly squeezed, as mothers and fathers
juggle the demands of work and caring for children, and often an older relative.
The problems mount for the next generation too. Young people are taking on
a mountain of debt to go to university and too many still cannot find a job
worthy of their talents. We lack a proper system of vocational education and
apprenticeships to give our young people the start in life that they deserve.
We are not building the homes we need. Our sons and daughters have been
shut out of the housing market and too often they are forced to leave the
communities where they were brought up.
Our economy and our system of government are failing people. Many have
come to believe that politics ignores the things that matter to them. Too much
power is unaccountable, concentrated in the market and the state, at the
expense of individuals and their communities.
Many of these problems have been mounting for years. Some, like the rise of
inequality, are felt in countries all around the world. So the Conservatives did
not cause all of them, but they have made them far worse. Their view is that
economic success depends just on a few at the top. They think that insecurity


will make people work harder and that low pay is the only way to be competitive
in the global market. They don’t believe we can afford decent public services
when times are hard. They have been giving power to large unaccountable
firms rather than to people, and now they want to make deeper cuts in the next
three years than we have seen in the last five years.
There are some who believe there is nothing we can do to change things for
the better. They feel powerless. They are losing faith that those with power
will ever listen to them. We understand these feelings. But we believe we can
renew our country and make a better future for working people. We have
learned the lessons of the past. We were in government for thirteen years and
left the country a far better place to live in. But we did not get everything right.
We have learned and we have changed.
Labour is renewing our traditions as the Party of work, family and community.
We believe in a society of trust and mutual obligation, in which we look after
the vulnerable, and people can bring up their families with hope for a better
future. And we believe in helping people to help themselves, both to improve
their own communities, and to achieve their ambitions.
We are also the Party of equality. We believe that no person should suffer
discrimination or a lack of opportunity. The decisions we take in government
will always be taken with this in mind. The policies in our manifesto will help
remove the barriers that stand in the way of greater equality. We know we
achieve more when we work together to challenge inequalities of power and
build a common good.
In this election, the country has a choice. We can continue with a Conservative
plan based on the view that success comes only from a privileged few at the
top. Or we can change direction, begin to return power to people and build an
economy together in which everyone can contribute to a shared and enduring
prosperity.
We believe that Britain only succeeds when working families succeed. As the
economy at last recovers, people want the opportunity to use their skills and
talents to make a better life for themselves and their children. Our country’s
greatest asset is the hard work and talent of our people.


Labour’s plan is to build firmer economic foundations for creating wealth,
rewarding hard work and competing in the world.
We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on
the current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the
next Parliament. This will need common sense spending reductions, outside
of the protected areas of health, education and international development.
We will ask those with incomes over £150,000 a year to contribute a little more
through a 50p rate of tax. And we will build the high-skill, high-wage economy
we need to raise tax revenues and control social security spending.
We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National
Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, banning exploitative
zero-hours contracts and promoting the Living Wage. We will create more
paths to success for our young people by introducing a gold-standard system
of technical education and training, and the guarantee of an apprenticeship for
every school leaver with the grades.
We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for
working parents of three and four-year-olds, while doubling paid paternity
leave for fathers. We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until
2017, while reforming the broken energy market. And we will make sure that at
least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, and that private renters get
a fairer deal. The Bedroom Tax is cruel and we will abolish it.
We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs,
20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax
on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling
tax avoidance. And we will bring together services for physical health, mental
health and social care into a single system built around the individual.
We want a high quality education for all of our children. We will protect the
education budget and raise teaching standards, making sure there are smaller
class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.


The common life we share is who we are as a country. Not everyone is the
same, but each of us sharing a sense of belonging, being valued equally and
being able to contribute to the common good. Immigration has made an
important contribution to our economic and social life, but it needs to be
properly controlled. With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not
be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years. We will
make it illegal to undercut wages by exploiting migrant workers, and work to
strengthen integration within our communities. Everyone who works with the
public in our public services must be able to speak English.
We will help to make communities safer, by protecting and strengthening
neighbourhood policing, countering extremism, and putting in place tough
new laws to reduce violence against women and child sexual exploitation.
People want more say in the decisions that affect their lives. We, in Labour,
know that Government has to do things differently. The old command and
control politics – doing things to and for people, but never with them – will not
work. We need a new approach to government that involves more people in
decisions that affect them. So we will devolve more power and control, not only
to Scotland and Wales, but to our great English cities and county regions too.
And we will share power and responsibility with people in their communities to
help them help themselves and shape their services in response to their local
circumstances.
Our country faces global challenges of climate change, terrorism and the spread
of disease. In particular, tackling climate change is an economic necessity and
the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and
future generations. A Labour government will face up to these challenges and
re-engage with the world. We will build alliances in Europe, promoting our
country’s interests and security, and standing up for human rights and social
justice. We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our
membership of it.
Labour’s plan for national renewal will bring about real, meaningful change that
each person will be able to feel in their daily life. We know that to make Britain


a better country, opportunity must belong to everyone and not just a few. We
will lend a helping hand to all those who need it, but we will also ask more of
individuals and communities. We can only rebuild our country if everyone plays
their part and feels they have a stake in society.
We believe in living within our means. We will not make promises we cannot
keep, and we will not introduce changes unless they are funded. There is not
a single policy in this manifesto that is funded by additional borrowing. Not a
single one.
Our plan is to build a secure, prosperous and more equal country open to
the world, in which everyone has the opportunity to get on and do their best.
We will provide strong and effective government but everyone will need to
contribute and play their part. It will be hard, but working together we can do it.


We will build an economy that works for working people

We know a simple truth. Britain only succeeds when working families
succeed. It is how our country has won through in the past and how
it will succeed in the future. But so many people are putting in the hours
and not seeing the rewards. That is why there is a cost of living crisis. Our
first task in government is to change our economy so that it works for all
of Britain’s businesses and working people.
The Conservatives claim that the economy is fixed and that our country is on
the right track. But the economy is not creating the productive, high-skilled
and well-paid jobs that we need to raise living standards. The lack of rewarding
work and training opportunities is trapping hundreds of thousands of young
people in a cycle of benefits and low-paid, insecure jobs. And consumers are
overcharged in markets they rely on to meet their everyday needs, whether to
heat their homes or travel to work.
For most of the 20th century, there was a vital link between the success of
the country and family finances. As the country got better off, so did working
people. But the link between the success of the country and the family budget
has been broken. Since 2010, working people are earning on average £1,600
less a year after inflation. We have seen the greatest fall in wages over a
parliament since 1874.
Over five million people are in low-paid jobs, earning less than the Living Wage.
There are 1.8 million zero-hours contracts. 1.3 million are working part-time
because they cannot get a full-time job. Half of all those in poverty live in
working households. 900,000 people, many of them in work, used food banks
last year.
This cost-of-living crisis is bad for families, bad for business, and bad for Britain.
Lower levels of pay have meant lower tax receipts and higher spending on
social security.
We will have to work and earn our way toward a more fairly shared and
enduring prosperity. We are a great commercial nation that has been at the
centre of global trade for centuries. We have a long tradition of innovation and
enterprise.


We have been quick to seize the opportunities of the internet. We have big
strengths to build upon: world-leading universities, an outstanding science
research base, an open economy with one of the highest rates of foreign direct
investment in the world, and many successful global companies.
An inclusive wealth-creating economy works when there is a shared sense
of responsibility, so we will be a government that is both pro-business and
pro-worker. We value all our businesses as organisations of innovation and
wealth production, and we will work strategically with them to create wealth.
We value our trade unions as an essential force for a decent society and as
guarantors of skills and fair wages.
A Strong Economic Foundation
The next Labour Government will balance the books. We will only lay a Budget
before the House of Commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the Office
for Budget Responsibility will independently verify. We will get national debt
falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next
Parliament and these fiscal commitments will not be compromised. We will
tackle the root causes of the deficit by building a more productive economy
with living standards that rise year-on-year.
The Conservative-led Government promised to balance the books in this
Parliament. But this promise has been broken. The Conservatives will leave the
country borrowing over £75 billion this year.
Labour’s plan to balance the books means making tough, but fairer choices. We
will reverse the Government’s top-rate tax cut so that the highest one per cent
of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get
the deficit down. We will stop paying Winter Fuel Payments to the richest five
per cent of pensioners, and cap child benefit rises for two years. Outside of the
protected areas of health, education and international development there will
be cuts in spending. Ministerial pay will be cut and then frozen until we have
balanced the books. All proceeds from the sale of our stakes in Lloyds and RBS
will be used to repay the national debt.


We will live within our means. We have no proposals for any new spending paid
for by additional borrowing. All of our commitments will be paid for by reducing
spending elsewhere or by raising extra revenue. For example, we will introduce
a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for
an NHS Time to Care Fund – part of our plan to save and improve the health
service. We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto
commitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at
each general election.
We will cap structural social security expenditure in each spending review
so that it is properly controlled. We will implement the proposals of Labour’s
Zero-Based Review, which has already identified savings we will make through
reforming old government bureaucracies, devolving power and services to our
towns and cities, and redesigning public services, and which we will continue
in government. We will invest to prevent social problems rather than waste
money reacting to them. And we will use digital technology to create a more
responsive, devolved, and less costly system of government.
Fairer taxes
We will create a fairer tax system, helping those on middle and lower incomes
by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax, paid for by ending the
Conservatives’ Marriage Tax Allowance. We will not increase the basic or higher
rates of Income Tax or National Insurance. Nor will we raise VAT, and we renew
our pledge not to extend it to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers or
public transport fares.
Our first Finance Bill will close the tax loopholes that cost the Exchequer billions
of pounds a year. We will introduce tougher penalties for those abusing the
tax system, end unfair tax breaks used by hedge funds and others, and bear
down on disguised employment. We will seek international agreement to make
country-by-country reporting information publicly available, and we will act
at home if agreement is not reached. British Overseas Territories and Crown
Dependencies will be required to produce publicly available registries of the
real owners of companies based there.


We will carry out an immediate review into the culture and practices of HMRC
so that everyone follows the same rules and we increase the rigour of the tax
system. And we will abolish non-dom status so that all those who make the UK
their home pay tax in the same way as the rest of us.
It is by tackling tax avoidance in this concerted fashion that we can reduce the
deficit and protect the family budgets of working people.
Improving productivity and a new industrial
strategy
Labour will improve productivity by building a long-term investment culture
in the private and public sectors, and supporting small businesses in their
growth to becoming British success stories of the future. With Labour, Britain
will continue to have the most competitive rate of Corporation Tax in the G7.
Building world-class infrastructure will be crucial to fostering economic growth.
We will create certainty for investors by taking a long-term approach to the
major investment decisions facing the country. We will set up an independent
National Infrastructure Commission to assess how best to meet Britain’s
infrastructure needs. It will make recommendations to government, monitor
their implementation, and hold government to account. These measures and
our long-term approach will help reinforce Britain’s status as one of the world’s
greatest centres of science and engineering.
We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs
down, and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to
boost its regional economies. We will support long-term investment in strategic
roads, address the neglect of local roads, and promote cycling.
Following the Davies Review, we will make a swift decision on expanding airport
capacity in London and the South East, balancing the need for growth and the
environmental impact.


Scientific discovery and technological innovation will drive economic
advancement this century. We will introduce a new long-term funding policy
framework for science and innovation, providing the stability and continuity that
our companies and research institutes need to succeed.
We will work to make Britain a world leader in low carbon technologies over the
next decade, creating a million additional green jobs. This aim will be supported
by ambitious domestic carbon reduction targets, including a legal target to
remove the carbon from our electricity supply by 2030, and a major drive for
energy efficiency.
Our industrial strategy for the green economy will end the current uncertainty for
investors, with a timetable for the Green Investment Bank to be given additional
powers so that it can invest in green businesses and technology. We will create
an Energy Security Board to plan and deliver the energy mix we need, including
renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal.
For onshore unconventional oil and gas, we will establish a robust environmental
and regulatory regime before extraction can take place. And to safeguard the
future of the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a long-term strategy
for the industry, including more certainty on tax rates and making the most of
the potential for carbon storage.
Labour’s longer-term approach will drive innovation and build on our strengths
as a leader in digital technology. We are just at the start of the internet revolution.
Digital technology has transformed start-up costs making it easier to run your
own business. There is a widening in the application of new transformative
technologies in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3D printing and Big Data. Our
economy is developing a network of connections that will revolutionise innovation.
Labour will ensure that all parts of the country benefit from affordable, high
speed broadband by the end of the Parliament. We will work with the industry
and the regulator to maximise private sector investment and deliver the mobile
infrastructure needed to extend coverage and reduce ‘not spots’, including in
areas of market failure. And we will support community-based campaigns to
reduce the proportion of citizens unable to use the internet and help those who
need it to get the skills to make the most of digital technology.


Our universities are amongst the finest in the world. Some are already helping
our regional economies by forming strong links with industry and creating
high-tech clusters. They have already spun out hundreds of companies creating
thousands of jobs. We will support this model of knowledge clusters, especially
outside the South East.
Britain’s economy is being held back by the culture of short-termism, which is a
major obstacle to the development of productive businesses and industries. We
will reform corporate governance to protect our leading firms from the pressure
to put tomorrow’s share price before long-term growth potential.
Institutional investors will have a duty to act in the best interests of ordinary
savers. They will have to prioritise long-term growth over short-term profits for
the companies in which they are investing. We will change takeover rules to
enhance the role of long-term investors by restricting voting to those already
holding shares when a bid is made. In addition, we will strengthen the public
interest test.
We will improve the link between executive pay and performance by simplifying
pay packages, and requiring investment and pension fund managers to disclose
how they vote on top pay. And we will make sure employees have a voice when
executive pay is set by requiring employee representation on remuneration
committees.
In this way we can start to create an economy based on mutual obligations,
encouraging employers and employees to build partnerships for improving both
business performance and job quality. Outdated practices, like blacklisting, have
no place in a modern economy.
Our charities, mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises are pioneering new
models of production that enhance social value, promote financial inclusion,
and give individuals and communities power and control. We will continue
to support and help develop the social economy by improving access for
co-operative and mutual organisations to growth finance through the new British
Investment Bank. And we will consider how to support employee buy-outs when
businesses are being sold.


We will safeguard the public interest in the Royal Mail, supporting the creation
of a staff-led trust for the employee share, and keeping the remaining
30 per cent in public ownership. We will also support the universal service
obligation, ensuring competition does not undermine it and introducing
protections as necessary.
Backing small business
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Their creativity and
dynamism are vital for raising productivity and competing in the global economy.
Labour will give them a voice at the heart of government – a Small Business
Administration, which will ensure procurement contracts are accessible and
regulations are designed with small firms in mind.
We will address rising costs for small businesses and strengthen rules on late
payment. Labour will put small businesses first in line for tax cuts. Instead of
cutting Corporation Tax again for the largest firms, we will cut, and then freeze
business rates for over 1.5 million smaller business properties.
We will develop a banking system that works for businesses in every region
and every sector in Britain. The long-standing problems of our banking system
mean that too many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get the
finance they need to invest and grow.
Labour will establish a British Investment Bank with the mission to help
businesses grow and to create wealth and jobs. It will have the resources to
improve access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and will
support a network of regional banks.
We will increase competition on the high street. Following the Competition
and Market Authorities inquiry we want a market share test and at least two
new challenger banks. And we will deal with the scourge of household debt
by introducing a new levy on payday lenders, using the funds raised to boost
low-cost alternatives like credit unions.


Better work and better pay
Britain’s route to prosperity and higher living standards is through more secure
and better paid jobs. But Conservative policies are causing whole sectors of
the economy to be dragged into a race to the bottom on wages and skills.
The Government has weakened employment rights and promoted a hire-and-fire culture. Labour believes our economy can only succeed in a race to the top – competing in the world with better work, better pay and better skills.
Too many people do a hard day’s work but remain dependent on benefits. We
will raise the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October
2019, bringing it closer to average earnings. We will give local authorities a role
in strengthening enforcement against those paying less than the legal amount.
And we will support employers to pay more by using government procurement
to promote the Living Wage, alongside wider social impact considerations. Our
Make Work Pay contracts will give tax rebates to businesses who sign up to
paying the Living Wage in the first year of a Labour Government. Publicly listed
companies will be required to report on whether or not they pay the Living
Wage.
It is hard for Britain to succeed when employees feel insecure and employers
are undercut by those using exploitative working practices. Labour will ban
exploitative zero-hours contracts. Those who work regular hours for more than
12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract. We will abolish the loophole that
allows firms to undercut permanent staff by using agency workers on lower pay.
The Conservatives have introduced fees of up to £1,200 for employment tribunal
claimants, creating a significant barrier to workplace justice. We will abolish the
Government’s employment tribunal fee system as part of wider reforms to make
sure that affordability is not a barrier to workers having proper access to justice,
employers get a quicker resolution, and the costs to the tax payer do not rise.
Labour is the Party of work, and we value working life. We will push up standards
and boost productivity by implementing the commitments in Labour’s Workplace
and Business manifestos.


Supporting the next generation
Over 700,000 of our young people are unemployed. Too many of them do not
have the skills they need for work. And yet in the past year the number of young
people starting apprenticeships has fallen. The Government’s decision to triple
university tuition fees leaves young people either starting their working lives
burdened by £44,000 of debt, or without a clear alternative path to a decent
career.
Labour will cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, funded by restricting
tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners and clamping down
on tax avoidance.
We will tackle the growth of unpaid internships because thousands of highly
able young people who cannot afford to work for free are locked out of too
many of our professions.
We will introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax.
It will provide a paid starter job for every young person unemployed for over a
year, a job which they will have to take or lose benefits.
For too long we have failed to provide a system which makes the best use of
the talents of young people. So we will guarantee every school leaver that gets
the grades an apprenticeship. We will create thousands more apprenticeships
in the public sector, including the civil service. Every firm getting a major
government contract, and every large employer hiring skilled workers from
outside the EU, will be required to offer apprenticeships.
We will give employers more control over apprenticeships funding and
standards. In return, we will ask them to increase the number of high quality
apprenticeships in their sectors and supply chains. We will also give them the
powers to deal with any free-riding employers who do not train.
Labour’s apprenticeships will be gold-standard qualifications. We will re-focus
existing spending away from low-level apprenticeships for older people, and
towards a system where apprenticeships are focused on new job entrants,
lasting at least two years, and providing level three qualifications or above.


We will make sure that apprenticeships can lead to higher level qualifications
by creating new Technical Degrees and supporting part-time study. They will
be co-funded, co-designed and co-delivered by employers and they will be the
priority for expansion within our university system.
Young people who do not have the skills they need should be in training, not
on benefits. We will replace out of work benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds with a
new Youth Allowance dependent on recipients being in training and targeted
at those who need it most.
Mending the markets that people rely on
Labour will stand up for working families and businesses against vested
interests. We will reform the broken markets that people rely on most so that
families and businesses get a fair deal.
Energy bills have risen by over £300 since 2010. Many businesses say energy is
the biggest cost they face. Lack of competition and transparency has allowed
the large energy companies to get away with increasing bills when wholesale
prices rise, but not cutting them when they fall. The regulator has failed to take
decisive action to protect consumers.
Labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not
rise, and we will give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter. During
the freeze, we will reform the energy market so that it delivers fairer prices
and a better deal for working families. The generation and supply businesses
of the ‘Big Six’ energy companies will be separated. They will be required to
open up their books, and they will have to sell their electricity through an
open exchange. We will simplify energy tariffs and make it easier for people to
compare prices to get the best deal. We will protect small businesses by ending
unfair contracts and automatic rollovers to more expensive tariffs. A tough
new energy watchdog will enforce our reforms, with powers to strip energy
companies of their licences if they repeatedly harm the interests of consumers,
and protect off-grid households.


We will bring down energy bills by making homes more energy efficient,
delivering a million interest free loans for energy home improvements in the
next Parliament. For those on low incomes, we will make 200,000 homes
warm every year, delivered street-by-street by local authorities and community
organisations. Privately rented properties will have to meet a decency standard,
bringing warmth to a further three million homes.
The water industry, too, also requires reform. One in five people struggle to
pay their water bill. Despite this, only a fraction of customers have benefited
from the social tariffs offered by water companies. Under our reforms all water
companies will be required to sign up to a new national affordability scheme,
helping those who cannot afford to pay their water bill. And we will strengthen
the powers of the regulator to change licenses, limit price rises and enforce
industry standards.
Living standards have been hit by fare increases on public transport. Since
2010, rail fares have risen by 20 per cent, leaving passengers paying the highest
fares in Europe. Similarly, bus fares have risen by 27 per cent while at the same
time 2,000 bus routes have been cut.
Labour will reform our transport system in order to provide more public control
and put the public interest first. We will review the franchising process as a
priority to put in place a new system and avoid a repeat of the Conservatives’
franchising fiasco. A new National Rail body will oversee and plan for the
railways and give rail users a greater say in how trains operate. We will legislate
so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the
private train operating companies on a level playing field.
Rail fares will be frozen next year to help commuters while we implement
reforms. A strict fare rise cap will be introduced on every route for any future
fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the
cheapest ticket for their journey.
City and county regions will be given more power over the way buses are
operated in their area. They will be able to decide routes, bear down on fares,
drive improvements in services, and bring together trains, buses and trams
into a single network with smart ticketing.


Labour will:
- cut the deficit every year and balance the books as soon as possible in the
next Parliament
- reverse the 50p tax cut so that the top one per cent pay a little more to help
get the deficit down
- not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax, National Insurance or
VAT
- cut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive
corporate tax rates in the G7
- abolish non dom status
- increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October
2019 and introduce Make Work Pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms
becoming Living Wage employers
- ban exploitative zero-hours contracts
- guarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the
grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer
apprenticeships
- reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year
- freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this
winter
- introduce a British Investment Bank and support a network of regional banks.


- We will provide world-class health and education services

Our NHS, care services, schools, colleges and other public services
make up the essential fabric of our society. People need them to be
able to live secure and fulfilling lives. Britain needs them if we are to
succeed as a country. But under the Conservatives they are under threat.
The next Labour Government will protect, improve and invest in our public
services, while giving individuals and communities more control over
their design and delivery.
The NHS is one of our great national institutions, and it is one of Labour’s
proudest achievements. It embodies our belief that by the strength of our
common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone. But the future
of the NHS is under threat. The Conservatives have put the wrong values at its
heart, and patients are finding it harder to get the care they need.
Care is at the heart of Labour’s values. No-one should fear old age or be left
to struggle alone caring for a loved one. But too many older people suffer
insecurity, loneliness and exclusion. And the growing social care crisis is one
of the biggest challenges we face. Since 2010, billions of pounds have been
cut from budgets that pay for adult social care. The result has been 300,000
fewer older people getting vital care services, at the same time as the number
of older people in need of care is increasing.
A good education is vital to achieving personal fulfillment and economic
prosperity. A good society depends upon an education system that can open
minds and teach the skills and knowledge we each need to get on in life. But
our education system is failing to meet the needs of young people who do not
follow the traditional academic path from school to university.
Our public services are a measure of the strength and decency of our society.
But we need a change in how we design them by pushing power down and
organising them around individuals and families not centralised bureaucracies.
Good public services also need committed staff who are treated fairly and
whose ethos of service is respected. They require decisions on pay that prioritise
those on lower incomes, which are evidence-based, and which respect Pay
Review Body recommendations rather than brushing them aside irresponsibly.


Government spends far too much money dealing with the symptoms of
problems, instead of investing smaller amounts in dealing with their causes.
Every taxpayer pays the cost of low educational achievement, poor aspirations,
drink and drug misuse, and criminality. So we will promote early-years
intervention, supporting young children and their parents and dealing with
problems before they get out of hand.
We can save money and create more responsive services by building
co-operation between public services and organisations. Pooling funds across
local areas reduces inefficiency and avoids duplication. Services must be joined
up in ways that make sense to the people who use them.
Labour will use digital technology in reforming our public services. People will
be able to feed back on services quickly and simply, making sure their voices
are heard, stimulating improvement and saving on the costs of service failure.
The NHS
Labour will rescue our NHS, invest in its future and join up services from home
to hospital.
We will start with the promise of investment so that the NHS has time to care.
The NHS is struggling with staffing shortages. Accident and emergency is in
crisis, and more people are facing long waits for tests, treatment, or to see a
GP. Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more
midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy
on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance. The threshold for the Mansion
Tax will rise in line with house prices for these high-value properties, and those
on lower incomes will be protected with a right to defer the charge until the
property changes hands.
We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours, and on the same
day for those who need it. We will create a Cancer Treatments Fund so patients
have access to the latest drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. By 2020, patients will
wait no longer than one week for vital cancer tests. Catching the disease early


is critical, so we will raise public awareness of symptoms and make sure there
is training and support for GPs in spotting early signs.
The answer to the health challenges we face is not to set hospital against
hospital, but to join up services around patients’ needs. We will repeal the
Government’s Health and Social Care Act, scrapping the competition regime
and restoring proper democratic accountability for the NHS. We will establish a
sensible commissioning framework, based on the principle of an NHS preferred
provider, to stop the drive towards privatisation and make sure that NHS
services are not destabilised by competition and fragmentation. Where private
companies are involved in providing clinical services, we will impose a cap on
any profits they can make from the NHS, to ensure that the needs of patients
are always put first. We support the principles behind the negotiations on the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Treaty (TTIP). We will hold the
European Commission to account on issues of concern, including the impact
on public services and the Investor to State Dispute Settlement Mechanism.
And we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty.
Our health reforms will focus on prevention and early intervention, and joining
up services from home to hospital. When people cannot get to see their GP,
many go to A&E instead. When mental health problems are not spotted early,
people can deteriorate and need more intensive support. And when elderly
people cannot get the care they need at home, they are more likely to end up
in hospital.
The current system is too fragmented. It was not designed for the growing
numbers of people living with chronic conditions or multiple needs. Rather
than having three separate systems for dealing with physical, mental and social
care, we will create a whole person approach: a single service to meet all of a
person’s health and care needs.
This will be underpinned by new rights for patients. Vulnerable older people,
disabled people and those with complex needs will be helped to have more
control of their lives with the entitlement to a personal care plan designed


with them and shaped around their needs, the option of personal budgets
where appropriate, and a single named person to coordinate their care. They
will also receive better information and advice on managing their condition.
These changes will help to end the frustration of families sick of being passed
from pillar to post between different individuals and agencies.
Commissioning and budgets will be brought together at a local level to join
up services and make sure that providers are incentivised to help people stay
healthy and outside hospital, rather than simply waiting for them to fall ill.
Mental health will be given the same priority as physical health. People will
have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs
and medical treatments. To help address the problem of undiagnosed mental
illness, NHS staff training will include mental health. We will increase the
proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make
sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link
children up with support. To support young people’s health and wellbeing, we
will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example
through the use of mindfulness to build resilience. And we will set out a strategy
with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking
therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access school-based
counselling.
A greater emphasis on prevention and public health is essential, not just to
improve outcomes and tackle inequalities, but to ensure the NHS remains
sustainable. For example, 3.2 million people are currently diagnosed with
diabetes, and it is estimated that spending on treatment will rise from £10
billion to £17 billion a year over the next 25 years if action is not taken, such
as to reduce levels of obesity. We will set a new national ambition to improve
the uptake of physical activity and take targeted action on those high strength,
low cost alcohol products that fuel problem drinking. And we will set maximum
permitted levels of sugar, salt and fat in foods marketed substantially to
children.


Everyone involved in the NHS must learn lessons when things go wrong, for
example, from the failings at Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay. Labour
will prioritise action to improve care quality and patient safety. In addition to
recruiting extra nurses to help provide safe levels of staffing on wards, we want
every hospital death to be subject to an appropriate level of review. We will also
take action to modernise the regulation of healthcare professionals.
Care in older age
Labour will support people in their older age. Growing old should be a positive
and fulfilling experience. But our social care system is close to collapse, with
older people often receiving visits limited to just 15 minutes, provided by a
workforce that is too often undervalued.
Labour supports measures to cap the costs of care and will prioritise improving
the quality of care services.
Working with local authorities and care providers, Labour will end time-limited
15-minute visits, introducing year-of-care budgets to incentivise better care in
the home. By stopping the use of zero-hours contracts, where regular hours
are being worked, we will improve the working life of care workers.
For older people, the normal setting for care should increasingly be the home,
not the hospital. We will recruit 5,000 new home-care workers – a new arm
of the NHS – to help care for those with the greatest needs at home. This will
include supporting more people to remain at home at the end of their life,
including those who are terminally ill with the greatest care needs.
We will also introduce a system of safety checks to identify risks facing
vulnerable older people and enable preventative measures to be put in place,
such as grab rails to prevent falling.


The burden of the care crisis is falling on carers, especially women, who
account for six in every ten carers. Labour will introduce a new duty on NHS
organisations to identify carers so that they can be linked up with the right
support. We will ring-fence the money councils get for carers’ breaks to ensure
this money gets spent on carers.
A high quality education for all our children
Labour sees investment in education as an investment both in our children
and in the future of the country. We will protect the entire education budget,
including the early years, schools and post-16 education, so that it rises in line
with inflation.
However investment on its own is not enough. We need to create a route
to success for the 50 per cent of young people who do not go down the
traditional academic route. We will raise the standard and status of vocational
and technical education, with a high quality vocational route from school
through to employment. The Technical Baccalaureate, a vocational award for
16 to 18-year-olds, will combine a gold-standard qualification accredited by
employers, with a quality work placement.
We will transform high performing Further Education colleges with strong links
to industry, into new specialist Institutes of Technical Education, with a remit to
deliver the Technical Baccalaureate and higher-level skills. We will support more
young people to gain the core skills they need for employment and further
study. With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18
and undertake work experience between the ages of 14 and 16. And to ensure
young people are equipped to make the best choices for their future, we will
introduce a new, independent system of careers advice, offering personalised
face-to-face guidance on routes into university and apprenticeships.
We believe fundamentally that a world-class education system is made by
excellent teachers. With Labour, every teacher will need to gain qualified teacher
status. We will encourage teaching quality by creating new career routes for
teachers who are expert in their subject. These teachers will be able to attain


a new ‘Master Teacher’ status. Teachers will also be expected to update their
knowledge and skills as a condition of remaining in the profession, and we will
support plans for a new College of Teaching. These measures will help us close
the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers, and work
towards all children reading well by age 11. We have supported the successful
‘Teach First’ since its inception and will continue to do so.
A new School Leadership Institute will support headteachers and improve
school leadership. It will accredit gold-standard headship qualifications,
support leadership training and development, and identify and develop the
school leaders of the future.
The Government has attempted to oversee thousands of schools from the
centre. This approach is not working. Underperformance is going unchallenged
and parents do not have enough of a voice. Labour will introduce new Directors
of School Standards at a local level to monitor performance, intervene in
underperforming schools and support them to improve.
Where a majority of local parents have concerns about underperformance, or a dip in standards, they will be able to call in their local Director of School
Standards to hold a school to account.
Labour will promote innovation in schools. We will give all schools freedoms
currently only granted to some. Directors of School Standards will be responsible
for commissioning new schools where there is a shortage of school places,
encouraging innovative bids from established providers, good local authorities,
parents, teachers and entrepreneurs. They will also encourage local schools to
work together to improve the quality of education.
We will end the wasteful and poorly performing Free Schools programme, and
switch resources to where they are needed, allowing us to cap class sizes for
five, six and seven-year-olds at 30 pupils or under.
Private schools currently benefit from generous state subsidies, including
business rates relief worth hundreds of millions of pounds. We believe they
should do more to contribute to raising standards in state education to justify
receiving this subsidy. As a condition for continued business rate relief, private


schools will be required to form a meaningful partnership with a school, or
cluster of schools, in the state sector.
Children develop and learn best when they are secure and happy. We need
to help our children develop the creativity, self-awareness and emotional skills
they need to get on in life. We will introduce compulsory age-appropriate sex
and relationships education. We will encourage all schools to embed character
education across the curriculum, working with schools to stop the blight of
homophobic bullying.


Labour will:
- invest £2.5 billion more than the Conservatives to recruit 8,000 more GPs,
20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives
- guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours and cancer tests within one
week
join up services from home to hospital, with a single point of contact for all
who need it
- give mental health the same priority as physical health, with a new right to
access talking therapies
- repeal the Government’s privatisation plans, cap profits and put the right
values back at the heart of the NHS
- end time-limited 15 minute social care visits and recruit 5,000 new
home-care workers to support people in their home
- introduce a new gold-standard Technical Baccalaureate for 16 to-18-year
olds
- protect the entire education budget from early years through to post-16
education
- guarantee all teachers in state schools will be qualified
- appoint Directors of School Standards to drive up standards in every area
- cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds
- ensure all young people study English and Maths to age 18.


We will help our families and communities to thrive

As a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency.
But pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime
and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing
institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.
Labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out
of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong. We will help to
create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the
institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.
Supporting families and relationships
People’s relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various
shapes and sizes, is its bedrock. But low pay, the pressures of work and caring
for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.
We will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week
for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in
the bank levy. We will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary
school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their
local primary school. As well as helping parents, this will provide children with
before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations
and attainment. This will be underpinned by a new National Primary Childcare
Service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable
delivery of quality extracurricular activities.
Labour recognises the vital importance of the power of people’s relationships
to build the capacity for love, care and resilience. We will prioritise early years
intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore
the role of Sure Start centres as family hubs. Sure Start will have an obligation
to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities
and local childcare providers. More widely, we will encourage local services to
co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to
integrated early help.


We will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships,
and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care,
education and health of children.
More fathers want to play an active role in their children’s lives and families
want to spend more time together with a new baby. So we will double the
current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of
paternity pay from £140 to more than £260 a week. Many grandparents want
to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them
in doing so.
As a result of this Government’s failures, the commitment to ending child
poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met. However, we will never forget how
important a decent basic income is to a child’s prospects and wellbeing. That
is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the Office for Budget
Responsibility to monitor and report on progress.
We will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable
children and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse. We will
increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their
families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued. We will continue to
support Frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and
teachers will receive better training for working with children with special
educational needs and disabilities.
Building new homes
Britain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the
lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. Young people
have been priced out of home ownership. Fewer affordable homes are being
built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in
the private rented sector.
Everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy. We
will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020 – almost


double the current level – by implementing the recommendations of the Lyons
Review. It is only by building more homes that people’s aspiration for home
ownership will be fulfilled.
Our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities
new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live.
To help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local
authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in
areas of housing growth. And we will unlock a Future Homes Fund by requiring
that the billions of pounds saved in Help to Buy ISAs be invested in increasing
housing supply.
We want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes
rather than land banking and speculation. So we will introduce greater
transparency in the land market and give local authorities new ‘use it or lose it’
powers to encourage developers to build.
We will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small
builders, including through our Help to Build scheme, and by getting the public
sector building again. We will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital
investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system.
We will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes,
including higher council tax on long term empty properties. And to boost the
housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.
For the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make
three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises. A ban on
unfair letting agent fees will save renters over £600. We will drive standards up
by creating a national register of private landlords.
Homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis. Labour reduced
homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of
homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by
55 per cent. We are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of
homelessness and rough sleeping.


Restoring social security
Britain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides
security when people lose their jobs or fall sick, as well as a decent income
when they retire. The British people have always believed in the principle of
contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet,
and providing support in times of need.
To guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we
need to keep costs under control. Under this Government, the increase in low
pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit,
pushing up the social security bill.
To get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of
rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes. We will allow
local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are
claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that
the money is invested in building homes.
We will keep the household benefit cap and ask the Social Security Advisory
Committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas. And we will cap
structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is
properly planned and controlled.
Labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of
our system. So we will not cut tax credits. We want everyone who can to have
the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored
back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs. We will do more
to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers’
Maths, English and IT skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits. They will
be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting
a job. We support the principle behind Universal Credit – that there should be
a smooth transition into work – but it must be affordable and fit for purpose,
so we will pause and review the programme.


There will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out
of work for one year, and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for
two years. It will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits. And we
will commission a replacement for the Work Programme at a more local level,
working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed.
We will introduce a higher rate of Job Seekers Allowance for those who have
contributed over years. It will be funded by extending the length of time people
need to have worked to qualify.
Supporting disabled people to live independently
Alongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays
an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently,
and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.
Half a million families have been hit by the Bedroom Tax, and two thirds of
those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member. It is cruel, and
we will abolish it.
We will reform the Work Capability Assessment and focus it on the support
disabled people need to get into work. We will give an independent scrutiny
group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it. And we will introduce
a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work
get more tailored help.
Older people
Older people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish,
and to enjoy a secure retirement. Older people have contributed all their lives
and built the Britain that the next generation will inherit. So it is right that they
are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health
services and a system of care over which they have control. We will keep the
triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per cent, 


whichever is highest. And while increases in the state retirement age are
necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people
have time to plan for changes.
We have taken the tough choice to restrict Winter Fuel Payments for the
richest five per cent of pensioners, but we will guarantee that there will be no
additional changes to the Winter Fuel Payments, free TV licences or bus passes
for pensioners.
Alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good
value for those who have saved. We will reform the pensions market so that
pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement
rip-offs. We support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension
pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.
Controlling immigration with fair rules
For our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather
than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders, our
communities, and in the workplace.
Britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including
low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on
wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.
Despite the Conservatives’ promise to reduce net migration to tens of
thousands, it is now higher than it was when David Cameron entered Downing
Street. Broken promises erode trust.
Labour will never cut Britain off from the rest of the world. Our economy and
our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here,
including university students coming to study. But the system needs to be
controlled and managed so that it is fair. Low-skilled migration has been too
high and needs to come down. We need much stronger action to stop illegal
immigration.


Labour’s plan starts with stronger borders. We will recruit an additional 1,000
borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the UK. We
will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious
crimes coming to Britain, and to deport those who commit crimes while they
are here. We will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in
and out of the country. Short-term student visitor visas have dramatically
increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse, whilst welcoming
overseas university students who bring billions into Britain. And we will keep
the cap on workers from outside the EU.
We need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers,
which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled
migration. Labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting
wages by exploiting workers. We will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only
from overseas and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the
Gangmasters Licensing Authority where there is evidence of abuse.
We need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can
play their part in British society. People working in public services, in public
facing roles, will be required to speak English. Those who come here will not be
able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being
sent to families living abroad.
We will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively. We will end the
indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system, ending
detention for pregnant women and those who have been the victims of sexual
abuse or trafficking. And we will ensure Britain continues its proud history of
providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international
obligations, including working with the UN to support vulnerable refugees from
Syria.


Safer communities
Crime creates fear and insecurity. We can only live happy and fulfilled lives if
we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person
or property.
For too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their
communities. Neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of British policing,
is at risk of being destroyed. Anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather
than dealt with. Violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are
being caught. Far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the
services that are supposed to keep them safe.
Labour believes British policing is at its best when it is rooted in local
communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to
emergencies.
We will protect neighbourhood policing. By making different choices – to abolish
Police and Crime Commissioners, end the subsidy of firearms licenses, and
mandate police forces to work closer together – we will be able to safeguard
over 10,000 police officers for the next three years. This will be backed up
by a new statutory Local Policing Commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood
policing in every community.
We will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in
setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment
of local police commanders.
To raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become
Chartered Officers, holding a registration with the College of Policing, and able
to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be. A
new Police Standards Authority will replace the discredited Independent Police
Complaints Commission. And we will work with the police to improve ethnic
minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they
serve.


The next part of Labour’s plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place.
We will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the
wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions. And
we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with
tougher penalties for those who assault them.
The last Labour Government’s reforms of youth justice, which required agencies
to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and
the numbers of young people in prison. The next Labour Government will
extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders,
incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together
to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible,
divert them into a more constructive way of life. And we will work to embed
restorative justice right across the youth justice system.
We know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime. We will ensure
drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction, with proper
integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of
treatment. And we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive
substances, so called ‘legal highs’.
It is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child
abuse. We will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an
adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of
abuse, and strengthen the vetting and barring regime. A new child protection
unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the
prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.
We need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people. Labour will do more
to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning. Prisons
will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and
reducing their re-offending. We will also raise professional standards amongst
prison officers, including through the creation of Chartered Prison Officers, and
confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.


We will enact Britain’s first Victims’ Law to give victims of crime a voice and an
entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.
Ending violence against girls and women
Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner. At least
750,000 children a year witness domestic violence. Stopping violence against
women and girls is a priority for Labour.
We will publish a Violence against Women and Girls Bill, appoint a commissioner
to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence, and provide
more stable central funding for women’s refuges and Rape Crisis Centres.
We will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a
response to domestic violence. The gun licensing regime will be tightened, so
that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an
unrestricted license. And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape
suspects have their DNA recorded and stored.
Victims of domestic violence need far better support. So we will widen access
to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.
Tackling the threat from extremism
The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing. Hundreds of British citizens
have joined Islamic State – a movement that has engaged in savage violence,
and racial and religious hatred.
The British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so
again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.
With Labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt
and tackle terrorism. The Government were wrong to weaken counter terror
powers by scrapping Control Orders. With Labour, dangerous suspects will be
subject to proper controls.


Every government department will be engaged in the work of preventing
extremism and fighting terrorism. We will implement a much more rigorous
strategy for dealing with people returning from the Syrian conflict. Alongside
appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone
returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront
them with the consequences of their actions.
We will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing
technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards
that protect people’s privacy. This is why Labour argued for an independent
review, currently being undertaken by David Anderson. We will strengthen the
oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to
have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.
To defeat the threats of Islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the
personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism. The
Prevent programme was set up under the last Labour Government to stop
young people becoming radicalised. But this Government has cut the funding
and narrowed its focus. Much of the work to engage Muslim communities has
been lost.
We will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist
propaganda, stopping young people being groomed, and also building resilient
institutions for social integration. We applaud those faith communities who
have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.
We will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-Semitism
and Islamophobia. We will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in
schools, universities or on social media. And we will strengthen the law on
disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.
Arts and culture
Labour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations
and defines our heritage as a nation. The arts allow us to celebrate our common


humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. The arts should belong to
all and be open to all to take part in.
We will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every
young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening
creative education in schools and after-school clubs. Institutions that receive
arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people, and we
will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.
The last Labour Government made admission to our national museums
and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people
experiencing our greatest cultural treasures. We reaffirm our commitment to
universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national
heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.
Creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy. It is the source of
economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal. We will increase
the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.
We will create a Prime Minister’s Committee on the Arts, Culture and
Creative Industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions.
The Committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the Prime Minister.
Sport
Sport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride. It
is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of
excellence and strength of character. With a Labour Government our children
will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at school.
Football clubs are an important part of many people’s identity and sense of
belonging. They are more than just businesses. But despite their importance
in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective
means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run. Labour will provide


the means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs. We will introduce
legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at
least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the
club changes hands. We will also review the role of fan participation in other
sports.
We will ensure the Premier League delivers on its promise to invest five per
cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the
grassroots.
Protecting our environment
We feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife.
Land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they
contribute to our sense of identity. In a globalised world, our local environment
provides us with a sense of place and belonging.
As we set out in more detail later on, a Labour Government will play a leading
global role in tackling climate change. However, it will not be enough to simply
mitigate the threat of climate change. We must adapt to its damaging effects,
which are impacting on us today. We will produce an ambitious adaptation
programme, and the new Infrastructure Commission will prioritise investment
in flood prevention. We will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving
local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.
Labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature,
whoever they are, or wherever they live. So we will keep our forests in public
ownership, and promote access to green spaces in local planning. We will
support the work of the Natural Capital Committee to protect and improve
wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our
thriving tourism industry.


We will build on our strong record on animal welfare – starting with an end
to the Government’s ineffective and cruel badger cull. We will improve the
protection of dogs and cats, ban wild animals in circuses, defend the hunting
ban and deal with wildlife crime associated with shooting.
We want to create a world-leading Food, Farm and Fisheries sector that creates
better paid jobs and apprenticeships across the rural economy. We will put in
place a long-term strategy for the sector, promote the best of British produce,
and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of
the sector, and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major
supermarkets.


Labour will:
- extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three
and four-year-olds, and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to
wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm
- double paternity leave from two to four weeks and increase paternity pay
by more than £100 a week
- ensure at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, with first
priority for local first time buyers
- provide security for renters by guaranteeing three-year tenancies with a ceiling on excessive rent rises
- introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a Bank Bonus Tax
- abolish the Bedroom Tax
ensure migrants will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years
- make it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers
- protect neighbourhood policing by safeguarding over 10,000 frontline
police officers over the next three years
- give football fans a voice in club boardrooms.


We will reform government to give more power to people


People who live in this country know that too much power is
concentrated in too few hands. Those who make decisions on behalf
of others, whether they are in Westminster, the European Union, in
business, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable. Our over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities, county regions and towns from being able to take control and change
things for themselves. We will end a century of centralisation.
Labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible
when people are given the power to change things for themselves. Our
governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'Westminster knows best approach', and devolve power and decision-making to people and
their local communities.
From the City of London to Silicon Valley the world’s best industries tend to be
clustered geographically. And too often economic challenges can be too, from
our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns. So a Labour government
will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic
growth and prosperity. We will reform institutions and devolve power to
deal with the causes of our economic problems, and we will encourage local
authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.
Instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over
schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their
insights into what works and what does not. We will promote and encourage a
model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.
These measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as
a union of nations. They will begin to transform the relationship between the
citizen and the state.
We will further develop digital government to enable better communication,
more collaboration, and sharing of data between services. It will make services
and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use. To create a more
connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive,


transparent and accountable. We will continue to back the principle of ‘open data by default’, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.
A better politics
We will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by May 2016, and improve the
curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they
need to play a full part in British society. We will encourage young people’s
volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of ‘Step up to Serve’, and the National Citizens Service.
Drawing on the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, we
will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does
not leave millions unregistered, nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into
account the people who live in them. This will include block registration by
universities and care homes, extending Northern Ireland’s successful Schools
Initiative, and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration.
Labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the
big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.
We will safeguard our democracy by repealing the Lobbying Act, which has
gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists.
We will ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies. And we
will reform the legislative process to strengthen the public’s voice and to better
hold the government to account.
The United Kingdom
Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the
common good. But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union
now needs to evolve. As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional
Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.


Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate
of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom,
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber. It is also
time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of
legislation that only affects England. This includes the option put forward by Sir
William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs. These ideas
must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process.
England
We will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our English city and
county regions in a hundred years with an English Devolution Act. It will transfer
£30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over
economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support.
This will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local
bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network. We
will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business
rates raised from growth in their area.
Fair funding will be restored across England, alongside longer term multi-year
budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their
area and protect vital services. And an English Regional Cabinet Committee,
chaired by the Prime Minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the
relevant Secretaries of State and leaders of our major city and county regions.
In return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish
local Public Accounts Committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies
creates value for money for local taxpayers.
Devolution does not end at town halls. Local people know best about the
complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to
solve them.
The English New Deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities
more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of


their public services. It will support people who need care to live independently,
help troubled families to turn their lives around, and make sure that every child
has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.
We will give English people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local
NHS services. Patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the
very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to
hospital services.
We will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and
so preserve their local identities. Councils will be given the power to require
particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to
restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a
single high street. Communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in
their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing
betting shops – or ban them entirely – in response to local concerns.
Scotland
In September 2014, people across Scotland voted overwhelmingly for change.
Labour will keep its vow and implement the Smith Agreement in full. And we
will go further, with a Home Rule Bill to give extra powers to Scotland over tax,
welfare and jobs. Rates of income tax will be set in Scotland. Billions of pounds
of social security spending will be devolved, including benefits that support
disabled people. The Work Programme will also be devolved along with a
greater ability to invest in capital projects.
The new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered
by being part of the United Kingdom. We will maintain the Barnett formula, and
Scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across
the UK.


Wales
Labour will put Welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as Scottish
devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically
reserved, and that a Welsh legislature is a permanent feature of our constitutional
arrangements. We will take forward proposals from the Silk Commission to extend
the power the people of Wales have over their elections, transport and energy.
An all-Wales Policing Plan will give the Welsh people the ability to shape local
policing in Wales.
Wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the Barnett formula. So while the
Conservatives have cut the Welsh budget by £1.5 billion, we will establish a fair
funding settlement for Wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.
Northern Ireland
Labour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to Northern
Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement, and successive agreements. A
Labour Government will engage proactively with the Northern Ireland Executive
to support continued political progress, and deliver on it’s vision of a shared
future. We will ensure the economic pact between the UK Government and
Northern Ireland Executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which
contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Northern Ireland. We
will continue to work with the Irish Government to secure peace in Northern
Ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.
Rights and equality
The Labour Party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination
and we will continue to do so. People's differences are not excuses to treat
them badly or unjustly.


The next Labour Government will go further in reducing discrimination
against women, requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap
and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination. Where there is
evidence more progress is needed, we will enforce the relevant provisions
within the Equality Act.
We want our Parliament to look more like Britain. We are proud of our record
in strengthening the representation of women, ethnic minorities, and other
under-represented groups in politics and public life. We remain committed
to achieving a better balance in Parliament, including through the use of all-women shortlists in Labour Party parliamentary selection contests.
We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the
barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities. Our aim is to
make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary,
civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative
of our diverse country.
We will also build on our history of championing LGBT rights, tackling
homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.
Britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law, and Labour has a
proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting
equality and opportunity for all.
Thanks to the Human Rights Act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including
disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of
redress. The Conservatives want to leave the European Convention of Human
Rights, and abolish the Human Rights Act. A Labour Government will stand up
for citizens’ individual rights, protecting the Human Rights Act and reforming,
rather than walking away from, the European Court of Human Rights. And
we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our
democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to
those that need it.


Our Freedom of Information laws have shone a light into the darker corners
of government and are a crucial check on the power of the Executive. We will
extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are
included. And we will repair the damage done by this Government to the vital
safeguard offered by judicial review.
The media
The free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open
debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power. That is why the
concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy.
No one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion
and policy makers. No media company should have so much power that those
who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.
Yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate.
Labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no
media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century
media environment.
We remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations
of the Leveson Inquiry. We expect the industry to establish a mechanism for
independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as
set out in the Royal Charter, and agreed by all parties in Parliament. We made
a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal. We stand by that promise
and will keep it.
Our system of public service broadcasting is one of Britain’s great strengths.
The BBC makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life, and
we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money. We
will also commit to keeping Channel 4 in public ownership, so it continues to
produce vital public content.


Labour will:
- set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to determine the future of UK’s governance
- replace the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and Regions
- pass an English Devolution Act, handing £30 billion of resources and powers
to our great English city and county regions
- give new powers for communities to shape their high streets, including
power over payday lenders and the number of fixed-odds betting terminals
- meet our promises to devolve further powers to Scotland and Wales
- give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote
- create a statutory register of lobbyists
- ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies
- require large companies to publish their gender pay gap
- implement the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.


We will stand up for Britain’s interests in Europe and the world

We live in turbulent times. The rise of ISIL, an aggressive Russia
threatening its neighbours in eastern Europe, and continuing
economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, are each a challenge to our national
security. Labour is an internationalist party and believes Britain must
engage with the global challenges we face, but not try and solve them on
our own. We believe the Conservatives are damaging the interests of our
country by turning their backs on Europe, and isolating us abroad. We will
strengthen our national security, stand up for human rights, and work with
other countries to tackle terrorism, climate change, and eliminate extreme
poverty globally.
Britain has a unique influence in the world. We are the only country that is a
member of the UN Security Council, NATO, the G7, the G20, the Commonwealth
and the EU.
With Labour, Britain’s response to threats to our security will be based on
enduring principles. We will protect our national interests, and strengthen our
long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of NATO
and the European Union. We will advance our international engagement,
rather than retreating into isolation. We will maintain the best Armed Forces
in the world, capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable
security landscape. And we will support human rights, always putting individual
freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.
One of our first acts in government will be to conduct a wide-ranging review
of Britain’s place in the world and how we can best uphold our values and the
national interest.
Global challenges
We will take a multilateral approach to global challenges. We will continue to
uphold our key alliances. These include the United States, our allies in Africa
and Latin America, and our partners from across the Commonwealth. They


also include the European Union. The crisis in Ukraine over the past year has
demonstrated the importance of NATO and the EU standing up to external
threats in Europe’s eastern, and southern neighbourhoods. Labour will
continue to advocate an EU which looks outward to promote stability, peace
and prosperity on its borders.
Most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism.
ISIL’s barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such
as Al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security.
Following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, it was right that the UK joined
other nations in air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq. But military action alone
will not defeat ISIL. A long-term multinational political strategy, with regional
actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism
across the region.
A Labour Government will always do what is necessary to defend our country.
Beyond self-defence, Labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons
of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq. We will continue
the approach we have taken in this Parliament. A Labour Government would
not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable
diplomatic efforts have been exhausted, the action is proportionate and in
partnership with allies, whether there is a clear legal basis, and if there is a clear
plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.
Peace and security in the Middle East are one of Labour’s most important
foreign policy objectives. We remain committed to a comprehensive two-state
solution – a secure Israel alongside a viable and independent state of Palestine.
There can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking
action that would make peace harder to achieve. Labour will continue to press
for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic
resolution.
Labour will also continue to honour the UK’s commitment to support
Afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement.
In December 2014, the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan ended. We can
never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who have



sacrificed and risked their lives in Afghanistan to protect our national security.
As power and wealth continues to shift from West to East, our relationship with
Asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity. Labour will set up an Asia
Step-Change Taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with
regional partners, including China, both in the commerical realm, and in other
areas, from cultural exchange to human rights.
This commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign
policy across the world. We will continue to promote women’s rights. We
will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of
poverty and inclusive economic growth. We will appoint a Global Envoy for
Religious Freedom, and establish a multi-faith advisory council on religious
freedom within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. And we will appoint
an International LGBT Rights Envoy to promote respect for the human rights
of LGBT people, and work towards the decriminalisation of homosexuality
worldwide.
Europe
Labour believes that our membership of the European Union is central to
our prosperity and security. It is why we will work to change the EU, so that it
operates in the best interests of our country. And it is why we will re-engage
with our European allies to protect our national interest after five years of
Britain being sidelined in Europe and isolated abroad.
The economic case for membership of the EU is overwhelming. Over 3 million
jobs in the UK are linked to trade with the European Union, and almost half
of our trade and foreign investment comes from the EU. Competing in the
single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness
and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy. And it helps boost the
living standards of people across Britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and
investment.


Our reforms will help deliver a Europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply
more austerity and rising unemployment. Labour will focus on the completion
of the single market and tougher budget discipline, including on those items
where spending at the EU level can save money at the national level. That
means driving reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and a Commission-led
zero-based review of spending on EU agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency.
We will not join the Euro, and we will ensure EU rules protect the interests of
non-Euro members.
A Labour Government helped to introduce sensible measures at EU level to
protect the rights of British workers, and we remain committed to fighting to
protect these measures.
People coming to Britain from the EU to look for work are expected to contribute
to our economy, and to our society. So we will secure reforms to immigration
and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls,
which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer
when new countries join.
We will also continue to open up EU decision-making, and implement
institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among European citizens.
We will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over European
legislation, by arguing for a ‘red-card mechanism’ for member states, providing
greater parliamentary scrutiny.
Labour’s priority in government will be protecting the NHS and tackling the
cost-of-living crisis. It is not to take Britain out of Europe. However, Labour will
legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers
from Britain to the European Union without the consent of the British public
through an in/out referendum.
Defence and our Armed Forces
The primary duty of any government is the defence of the nation and its interests.
That is why Labour is committed to ensuring the UK has responsive, high-tech
Armed Forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnected


threats, in an unpredictable security landscape. We will conduct a Strategic
Defence and Security Review in the first year of government, with an inclusive
national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country. It will
be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that
impede our Armed Forces from effective response to threats.
At the heart of our defence policy are the service men and women, both regulars
and reservists, who risk their lives for their country. Labour will strengthen
the covenant between our nation and our Armed Forces, veterans and their
families. We will create a Veterans’ Register to make certain our veterans receive
proper support on leaving service.
We will continue to roll out Labour’s Veterans’ Interview Programme, in
which companies voluntarily guarantee an interview for job-seeking ex-forces
personnel. We will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members
of our Armed Forces illegal, and we will enshrine the Military Covenant in the
NHS Constitution.
The UK defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with a turnover of £22 billion a year. We will work to secure defence jobs across the
UK, protect the supply chain and support industry to grow Britain’s defence
exports. In partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money,
interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.
Britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks. We have
already called on the Government to require every company working with
the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign
up to a cyber-security charter. This would reduce the risk of hackers using
small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the
department itself. We will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all
private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national
infrastructure.
Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear
capability, delivered through a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent. We will actively
work to increase momentum on global multilateral disarmament efforts and


negotiations, and look at further reductions in global stockpiles and the
numbers of weapons.
Climate change
We will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy. As the
terrible impact of the floods in Britain showed last year, climate change
is now an issue of national, as well as global security. From record
droughts in California, to devastating typhoons in the Philippines,
the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future
generations would experience.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear that if
the world is going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally-agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then
decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this
century. The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the
reductions will need to be later.
The effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest. If we do not tackle
climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty. We will expand
the role of the Department of International Development to mitigate the
risks of a changing climate, and support sustainable livelihoods for the
world’s poorest people.
We want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the UNFCCC
conference in Paris, in December. We will make the case for ambitious
emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the
basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two
degree goal. And we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions
in the second half of this century, for transparent and universal rules
for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions, and for an equitable
deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in
combatting climate change.


International development
We are proud that Labour MPs passed the historic law that commits Britain to
spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development.
Labour will use that commitment from the British public to transform the lives
of the world’s poorest people, whilst ensuring value for taxpayers’ money. We
will work in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those
affected by violence, prioritising the protection and education of women and
children. We will rebalance the budget to focus funding on the world’s poorest
countries.
While progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals,
it is unacceptable that over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day.
We will work with other countries at this year’s Sustainable Development
Goals Summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty, tackle growing
economic inequality, and place human rights at the heart of development. We
will establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage to provide the support,
encouragement, and global partnerships needed to help countries provide
free healthcare. We will lead efforts to reshape the UN humanitarian system to
better equip it to save lives.
The private sector is essential to long-term development, and is often a positive
force for change. We will extend the sharing of tax information to developing
countries, increase DFID’s help to governments to collect more of their own
taxes, tackle corruption, and ensure good governance. We will work with
companies to ensure they have sustainable supply chains that are free from
slavery, treat their workers fairly, and pay taxes where they are due.


Labour will:
- conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in the first year of
government
- return Britain to a leadership role in Europe, but reform the EU so that it works for Britain
- guarantee no powers will be transferred to Brussels without an in/out
referendum
- appoint an International LGBT Rights Envoy and a Global Envoy for Religious Freedom
- outlaw discrimination against and abuse of members of the Armed Forces
- enshrine the Military Covenant in the NHS Constitution
- push for global targets to tackle inequality and promote human rights
- establish a Centre for Universal Health Coverage
- push for an ambitious target in Paris to get to goal of net zero global
emissions in the second half of this century.


Time for change
In this election the country has a choice.
Either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in
the City of London but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country.
A country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents
and an NHS under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.
Or we can change direction, together, with Labour.
We don't promise the earth. All our commitments in this manifesto are fully
funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.
But our policies will bring hope and make Britain work for working people once
again.
Working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills. Families
want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare.
Mothers and fathers want a better future for their children. Individuals and
communities in every part of our country want to have control over their lives
and for those in power to be held to account. Everyone, young and old, wants
a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.
We deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those
at the top.
That's what this manifesto offers. It is the kind of country we know we
have it in ourselves to be. Let's build it together.

Dear friend,
When Liberal Democrats launched our 2010 General Election
manifesto, few people expected that many of the policies it
contained would be implemented by the next Government. But
that’s what happened: three quarters of those policies formed the
backbone of the Coalition’s programme.
Front-page commitments like raising the Income Tax threshold
and investing in the poorest schoolchildren through the Pupil
Premium became flagship Coalition policies.
With Liberal Democrats in Government to deliver them, those
policies have started the work of building a stronger economy and
a fairer society, with opportunity spread across the whole United
Kingdom.
Despite tough economic circumstances, those policies are making a
difference to people’s lives and helping make Britain a freer, greener,
more liberal country.
But our mission has only just begun. You can’t build a stronger
economy and a fairer society, and spread opportunity to every
citizen, in five years.
For the first time, this is a Liberal Democrat manifesto that builds
on a record of policies delivered in national government.
We can say we will finish the job of balancing the books, but do
so fairly, because we have started that job in this Parliament.
We can say we will cut taxes for working people by raising the
tax-free allowance to £12,500 because we have raised the tax-free
allowance every year since 2010.
We can say we will protect funding for education from nursery to
19 because we have protected schools funding and invested in early


years education in Government.
We can say we will increase health funding and invest in mental
health because we have protected the NHS budget in Government
and introduced the first ever waiting-time standards for mental
health.
And we can say we will protect our environment because we have
almost trebled the amount of electricity from renewable energy in
this Parliament.
In our fast-changing world, the fundamental question political
parties face is: do we want to continue to be an open society,
confident and optimistic about our place in the world, or do we want
to become a closed one, increasingly insular and backward-looking?
For Liberal Democrats there is only ever one answer: we want an
optimistic, open-hearted and outward-looking United Kingdom.
In Government for the next five years, Liberal Democrats will
continue to build a stronger economy and a fairer society with
opportunity for everyone. This manifesto sets out how.
Yours,
Nick Clegg


Britain
in 2020:
the Liberal
Democrat
vision
This manifesto is a five year plan to build a fair, free and open
society in our United Kingdom. Follow this plan and by 2020, our
economy will be strong, sustainable and fair, our public finances will
be healthy again and there will be jobs that last in every part of the
country. Follow this plan and there will be opportunity for everyone
to get on and live the life they want –at work, at home, online and in
our communities.
We have to finish the job of sorting out the UK’s public finances
– but we must do it fairly, making sure the wealthiest pay their fair
share. Only the Liberal Democrat plan will keep the UK on track,
balancing the books in 2017/18 so we can get back to investing in
the public services and infrastructure that help make our country
strong. In 2020, debt will be falling as a share of our economy for
the fourth year in a row, steadily rebuilding our national resilience
against future economic shocks.
Our economy will be thriving, delivering balanced growth with
jobs that last in every nation and region. Government will take a
long-term approach to supporting business and industry, helping
supply credit, skilled workers and infrastructure. Over a third of


UK electricity will come from renewables, not least from Scottish
generators, and we will be leading the world in the technologies of
the future, from electric cars to tidal power.
Britain will be the place to be if you want to thrive in advanced
manufacturing, science, creative, digital and green industries, and
our country will be open to ambitious entrepreneurs and thinkers
from overseas. We will finally be building enough homes, every year,
to meet our needs.
By 2020, our plan will bring together a lifetime of opportunities
for every generation, enhancing the quality of all our lives. Mothers
and fathers will be able to share the joys and struggles of early
parenthood with extended Shared Parental Leave. Free, high-quality
childcare will be available the moment parental leave is over.
Education will prosper under the Liberal Democrats.
Young people will leave school and college confident about
their future: we will have doubled the number of businesses hiring
apprentices.
Society will be more equal. A million more women will be enabled
to work, with fairer rules to help everyone juggle family life, caring
responsibilities and the world of work. Carers will be treated with
respect and given more help, including a bonus of £250 to spend
however they choose. The tax system will be fairer: people will
not pay Income Tax on the first £12,500 they earn, but strict rules
will be in place to make sure the richest pay their fair share and
corporations cannot dodge their tax responsibilities. Targeted green
taxes will discourage pollution and reward sustainability.
There will be more jobs in our economy, with steadily higher
wages and better employment rights. With Universal Credit and
reforms to disability benefits, it will always pay to work, and
everyone who needs a helping hand will get one. As you work, and
as you save, you will feel confident about life after retirement, too.
Millions more will have a workplace pension. Our ‘triple lock’ will
protect the State Pension, our new single tier pension will mean your
savings are your own to keep.
Our NHS will have the money it needs, and the Scottish
Parliament will have the resources to make sure mental health
will have equal status with physical health. Those facing anxiety
and depression will be seen swiftly, people struggling not to harm
themselves will find emergency help at A&E and teenagers suffering


from eating disorders will get the help they need close to home.
Five green laws will be on the statute books, protecting nature and
wildlife in Britain and across the world, cleaning up our air and helping
fight climate change.
People will be more free. A second Freedoms Act will have
embedded citizens’ rights to freedom of speech and protest. The
Human Rights Act will remain, with children’s rights protected in law
too. The culture of everyday sexism will be declining, with young
people taught in school about respect in relationships and sexual
consent. Online, people will no longer be worried that the government
is monitoring their every keystroke: a Digital Bill of Rights will have
enshrined enduring principles of privacy and helped keep the internet
open.
Our politics will be open, and fairer too. 2020 will be the first
General Election in which 16 year olds can vote – the first generation
to cast their first ballot in a fair STV voting system and the first
generation to vote for the House of Lords. But every 16 year old will
know it’s not just UK elections that matter: Scotland will have home
rule powers as proposed by the cross-party Smith Commission,
and comprehensive devolution to Wales and Northern Ireland will be
completed too, keeping the course to a federal UK.
In 2020 Britain will be a force for good in the world, leading global
action against climate change, tax avoidance and international
crime, working to prevent conflict and offer humanitarian aid, and
promoting trade, development and prosperity. We will still be meeting
our commitments to spend 0.7% of our national income helping
the world’s poorest people. And we will be standing tall in our own
neighbourhood, a leader in the European Union again. We will have
secured real reform of the EU to deliver more jobs, more growth, and
more security. Our borders will be secure and our immigration system
fair. We will be working across borders to tackle crime and keep
Britain safe.
Our Liberal Democrat plan will build a stronger economy and
a fairer society, in a truly United Kingdom. Our plan will deliver
opportunity for everyone.


- Responsible finances
Balancing the budget in a fair way
A responsible approach to tackling the deficit
and our country’s debts is essential because it
underpins everything else we want to achieve.
In the last five years, we have worked hard to
bring balance back to Britain’s public finances.
The deficit is now half what it was when we took
office in 2010. Nevertheless, there is still work to
be done. Only Liberal Democrats will complete
the job on time in a way that is fair, enables
sustainable growth and protects public services.


Responsible finances underpin every good government. High debt
and deficits are a risk to economic stability and it is simply not right
to borrow too much money and expect our children to pay it back.
Debt interest payments last year were £46 billion: more than we
spent on schools.
A responsible approach to tackling the deficit and our country’s
debts is essential because it underpins everything else we want to
achieve. In the last five years, we have worked hard to bring balance

when we took office in 2010. Nevertheless, there is still work to be
done. Only Liberal Democrats will complete the job on time in a way
that is fair, enables sustainable growth and protects public services.
- Balancing the budget
We will complete the job of balancing the budget – on time, in
full, and fairly. The Liberal Democrat objective is to eradicate the
structural current budget deficit by 2017/18 and have debt falling as
a percentage of national income, so it is back to sustainable levels
by the middle of the next decade.


In 2010, Liberal Democrats insisted the coalition adopt a fairer
approach to dealing with the deficit, using both spending cuts and
tax rises, than the Conservatives had planned. This mixed approach
was much more in line with proposals set out in the Liberal
Democrat manifesto. The Conservatives now want to scrap this
approach entirely and use only spending cuts to finish the job. We
reject this proposal, which would do significant damage to Britain’s
public services and require punitive cuts to benefits on which some
of the most vulnerable people depend.
We are determined to stick with the approach we set out in 2010
– a fair way of restoring the nation’s finances. So as we finish the
job of balancing the books, we will use taxes on the wealthiest, on
banks and big business and on polluters, and we will bear down
on tax avoidance, to limit the impact of deficit reduction on public
services. We do not think low and middle income earners should
bear the burden of tax rises: our plans do not require any increase
in the headline rates of Income Tax, National Insurance, VAT or
Corporation Tax. In fact, our plans enable us to continue to cut
taxes for people on low and middle incomes by raising the tax-free
Personal Allowance.
Having a balanced approach on tax and spending enables us to:
- Protect the least well off in society and users of public services
from the impact of measures taken to tackle the deficit.
- Invest, over the Parliament, extra money for the NHS, essential to
protect our health service.
- Extend the current UK budget protection for education to include
early years and 16-19 provision. This will result in a stable funding
platform for the Scottish Parliament to invest in children and
young people.
- Limit reductions in departmental spending to less than half the
rate agreed for 2015/16.
- Limit welfare reductions so we do not destroy the essential safety
net that protects us all in times of crisis.
- Continue to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income on
international development aid, helping the poorest in the world.
We will carry out a full Spending Review after the General Election.
Building on the successes of this Parliament, we will focus on
delivering efficiency, funding proven spend-to-save initiatives and
investing in technology to get public services and frontline staff
online. The aim of everything that government does will be to help
people improve their quality of life and wellbeing, especially the most
vulnerable and least well off.


BORROW LESS THAN LABOUR
CUT LESS THAN TORIES


- Looking to the future
Once we have balanced the books, we will ensure that overall public
spending grows again in line with the economy. This will ensure we
can improve key public services and enable public sector workers to
receive fair and affordable increases in their pay. We understand that
public services depend upon high-quality and dedicated staff.
We will follow two new fiscal rules.
Our first fiscal rule is that, from 2017/18, debt must fall as a
proportion of our national income every year – except during a
recession – so it reaches sustainable levels around the middle of the
next decade.
Our second fiscal rule is that over the economic cycle we will
balance the overall budget, no longer borrowing to pay for everyday
expenditure. We will make one significant exception to enable us to
invest in the things that will help our economy grow. Provided the
debt rule is met, the government will be able to borrow for capital
spending that enhances economic growth or financial stability,
enabling us to increase this productive investment.
In our Spending Review we will set out long-term plans for capital
expenditure, and ensure that investment in infrastructure, including
in housing and energy efficiency, continues to rise both in absolute
terms and as a share of the economy.

Our plan to finish the job and
balance the books
- Aim to balance the structural current budget by 2017/18.
- Set a course to reduce debt as a share of national income.
- Make deficit reduction fair by ensuring the richest pay
their fair share and corporations cannot avoid their tax
responsibilities.
- Set new fiscal rules to balance the budget while allowing
borrowing for productive investment.
- Increase public spending again in line with the economy
once the budget is balanced.


- Prosperity for all
Building a sustainable economy
Britain needs a strong economy not just to help
fund public services but because growth and
enterprise create jobs and opportunities for all.
Liberal Democrats want an economy that is
strong, green, open and fair. As Britain recovers,
we must make sure we don’t return to growth
based on personal debt and speculation, but
build prosperity and wellbeing that last, for
everyone.

all. Liberal Democrats want an economy that is strong, green, open

growth based on personal debt and speculation, but build prosperity
and wellbeing that last, for everyone.
We will grow a high-skill, low-carbon economy by supporting
education, training, infrastructure, innovation and technology. With
a stable, competitive business environment and investment in green
industries and infrastructure, we will ensure growth is embedded in
every part of the UK.
We have made a big start in government: reforming the banking
system; creating the world’s first Green Investment Bank; enabling
unprecedented investment in low-carbon energy; introducing a
Regional Growth Fund and a bold new Industrial Strategy to support
growth and high-skilled jobs; delivering more than two million new
apprenticeships; ensuring transparency of company ownership and
promoting more diversity in business leadership.
Now is the time to push forward and reject any temptation to go
back to the old economy. Whether it’s fighting for proper investment
in renewable energy, or working to build a high-skill, flexible labour
market: Liberal Democrats will ensure Britain doesn’t return to the
mistakes of the past.

A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Economic and industrial growth
To deliver a balanced economy with strengths in every part of the
UK, Britain needs a highly skilled workforce and flexible business
support and finance. We must continue to invest to grow sectors like
advanced manufacturing that can provide high-skilled, sustainable
jobs, open up the supply chain to more small and medium-sized
businesses and support firms bringing activity back to Britain.
We will:
- Continue to develop our Industrial Strategy, working with sectors
which are critical to Britain’s ability to trade internationally – motor
vehicles, aerospace, low-carbon energy, chemicals, creative
industries, offshore and subsea technology and more.
- Develop the skilled workforce needed to support this growth with
a major expansion of high-quality and advanced apprenticeships,


offering vocational education on a par with academic
qualifications, backed up with new sector-led National Colleges.
We will develop a national skills strategy for key sectors, including
low-carbon technologies, to help match skills and people.
- Aim to double innovation and research spending across the
economy, supported by greater public funding on a longer
timescale, more ‘Catapult’ innovation and technology centres and
support for green innovation from the Green Investment Bank. We
will continue to ringfence the science budget and ensure that, by
2020, both capital and revenue spending have increased at least
in line with inflation.
- Build on the success of the Regional Growth Fund, which has
already created more than 100,000 jobs and secured £1.8 billion
of private investment. We will continue the Fund throughout the
next Parliament.
- Devolve more economic decision-making to local areas, building
on the success of City Deals and Growth Deals, prioritising the
transfer of transport, housing and infrastructure funding, skills
training and back-to-work support.
- Provide further support to medium-sized businesses through a
one-stop-shop for accessing government support, a dedicated
unit in HMRC and the development of management skills.
- Aim to stimulate local economies, working with Local Enterprise
Partnerships to improve their effectiveness and coordination. We
will:
- Use central government public procurement policy as
a tool of local growth and community development, for
example by purchasing from diverse sources and using
local labour, goods and services, and encourage local
government to do the same.
- Continue our work to open up public procurement to small
and medium-sized companies and to the voluntary sector.
- Develop platforms on which government can provide
feedback on its suppliers to help quality providers to grow.
- Banking and financial reform
The financial crisis of 2008 caused real damage to our economy
including one of the largest budget deficits in the world and banks
unable to support the real economy. Liberal Democrats have
ensured radical reform of the banking industry to make banks safe
and no longer requiring a taxpayer safety net.


Building on this progress, we will:
- Complete implementation of the new rules to separate retail
banking from investment banking, working with the financial
services industry to promote integrity, accountability and value
across the sector.
- Expand the British Business Bank to perform a more central
role in the economy, tackling the shortage of equity capital for
growing firms and providing long-term capital for medium-sized
businesses.
- Develop the UK banking sector to promote competition and
innovation by:
-Facilitating new entrants, including through public
procurement policy.
-Encouraging the growth of crowdfunding and alternative
finance models, encouraging Local Authorities to use these
platforms to improve credit access in their areas.
-Promoting a new community banking sector to support
small and medium-sized enterprises and social enterprises.
-Taking forward the recently commissioned study by the
British Business Bank into the sustainability of Community
Development Finance Institutions.
- Ensure access to finance for all, tackling discrimination in the
provision of financial services and supporting products that
increase financial inclusion.
- Continue the Banking Levy and introduce a time-limited
supplementary Corporation Tax charge on the banking sector
to ensure it continues to make a fair contribution to fiscal
consolidation.
- Creating a stable and competitive environment
for growth
Britain needs a stable and competitive environment for growth; this
is essential to attract and sustain new businesses and new jobs.
Britain is not just a part of the European economy – we have to
compete with the developing economies of Asia and Latin America,
which are increasingly powering ahead.
We need to lock in macroeconomic stability, including low
inflation, and reduce the risks of a return to the economics of
boom and bust. And we need a tax system that is simple, fair and
competitive – which attracts and retains jobs in our country, while
ensuring business makes a fair contribution.


We will:
- Continue to support an independent Bank of England, with a
mandate to keep inflation low and stable to support sustainable
growth. We will protect the new regulatory framework, which
ensures the Bank of England has the necessary tools to help
avoid a return to boom and bust.
- Continue to reform business tax to ensure it stays competitive,
making small and medium-sized enterprises the priority for any
business tax cuts. We will work to adjust the tax system away
from subsidy of high leverage debt and tackle the bias against
equity investment.
- Reform and improve the Regulatory Policy Committee to reduce
regulatory uncertainty and remove unnecessary business
regulation. We understand that well-designed regulation, focused
on outcomes rather than processes, has a vital role in creating
markets and driving investment and will use it, in particular, to
promote low-carbon and resource-efficient innovation.
In England we will complete the ongoing review of Business Rates,
prioritising reforms that lessen the burden on smaller businesses,
ensure high streets remain competitive and promote more efficient
use of land. Liberal Democrats remain committed to introducing
Land Value Tax (LVT), which would replace Business Rates in
the longer term and could enable the reduction or abolition of
other taxes. We will extend the Business Rates review to ensure
it considers the implementation of LVT, as well as interim reforms
like Site Value Rating that could be completed within five years.
We will charge the Land Registry with completing registration of
all substantial land and property holdings in England and Wales by
2020.
- Green jobs and industry
New world markets are developing in low-carbon and resource-efficient
technologies. Britain’s real strengths in sectors like offshore
wind power and low-carbon vehicles, and in green finance, make us
well placed to compete.
We must make sure green industries can reach their full potential
and build on successes in increasing recycling to shift towards a
so-called ‘circular economy’ in which we use natural resources
efficiently and minimise waste. (See also Section 6.2)
We will:
- Pass a Zero Carbon Britain Act to set a new legally binding target


to bring net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
- Realise the full potential of the Green Investment Bank by
increasing its capitalisation, expanding its remit, allowing it to
raise funds independently and enabling it to issue green bonds.
- Place the Natural Capital Committee (NCC) on the same statutory
footing as the Committee on Climate Change through our
Nature Act. We will task the NCC with identifying the key natural
resources being used unsustainably and recommending legally
binding targets for reducing their net consumption; and introduce
incentives for businesses to improve resource efficiency.
- Help incentivise sustainable behaviour by increasing the
proportion of tax revenue accounted for by green taxes.
- Grow the market for green products and services with steadily
higher green criteria in public procurement policy, extending
procurement requirements more widely through the public sector
including to the NHS and Academy schools. In particular we will
deliver ambitious reductions in energy use.
- Increase research and development and commercialisation
support in four key low-carbon technologies where Britain could
lead the world: tidal power, carbon capture and storage, energy
storage and ultra-low emission vehicles.
- Ensure UK Trade and Investment and UK Export Finance can
prioritise support for key sectors identified in our Industrial
Strategy, including exports of green products and technologies,
and press for higher environmental standards for export credit
agencies throughout the OECD.
- Encourage the creation of green financial products to bring
consumer capital into green industries.
We will improve the way government handles the cross-cutting
challenges of delivering green growth and fighting climate change,
establishing a senior Cabinet Committee to coordinate action and
bringing together officials in inter-departmental units on issues
like air quality and resource management. We will replicate the
success of the Office for Budget Responsibility with an Office for
Environmental Responsibility scrutinising the government’s efforts to
meet its environmental targets.
- Making the connection: transport infrastructure
Liberal Democrats are leading the renewal of Britain’s ageing
infrastructure but we still have decades of under-investment to catch
up on. We need better transport infrastructure, a modern railway
system, and less congestion on our roads.
We have established our second fiscal rule precisely so we can
invest in productive infrastructure to help the economy grow.


We will:
- Set out 10-year rolling capital investment plans.
- Develop a comprehensive plan to electrify the overwhelming
majority of the UK rail network, reopen smaller stations, restore
twin-track lines to major routes and proceed with HS2, as the first
stage of a high-speed rail network to Scotland.
- Invest in major transport improvements and infrastructure. We will:
- Deliver the Transport for the North strategy to promote
growth, innovation and prosperity across northern England.
- Develop more modern, resilient links to and within the
South West peninsula to help develop and diversify the
regional economy
- Complete East-West rail, connecting up Oxford
and Cambridge and catalysing major new housing
development.
- Ensure London’s transport infrastructure is improved
to withstand the pressure of population and economic
growth.
- Work to encourage further private sector investment in rail freight
terminals and rail-connected distribution parks. We will set a
clear objective to shift more freight from road to rail and change
planning law to ensure new developments provide good freight
access to retail, manufacturing and warehouse facilities.


- Ensure our airport infrastructure meets the needs of a modern
and open economy, without allowing emissions from aviation
to undermine our goal of a zero-carbon Britain by 2050. We will
carefully consider the conclusions of the Davies Review into
runway capacity and develop a strategic airports policy for the
whole of the UK in the light of those recommendations and advice
from the Committee on Climate Change. We remain opposed to
any expansion of Heathrow, Stansted or Gatwick and any new
airport in the Thames Estuary, because of local issues of air and
noise pollution. We will ensure no net increase in runways across
the UK.
- Ensure new rail franchises include a stronger focus on customers,
including requirements to integrate more effectively with other
modes of transport and a programme of investment in new
stations, lines and station facilities. We will continue the Access
for All programme, improving disabled access to public transport.
Modern light rail systems, like Croydon Tramlink and Manchester
Metrolink, have brought significant benefits to passengers. We
will encourage Local Authorities to consider trams alongside other
options, and support a new generation of light rail and ultra-light rail
schemes in towns and cities where local people want them.
- Low-carbon energy
Our reforms of the electricity market have already created the
world’s first low-carbon electricity market and will stimulate up to
250,000 green jobs across the UK by 2020. Since 2010, energy
demand has fallen by 2.5% a year and renewable electricity
generation has almost trebled.
But we need to go further and faster to meet our goal of reducing
energy demand by 50% by 2030. If we do not speed up energy
efficiency investment, our buildings will continue to leak energy and
waste money and our businesses will fail to compete internationally.
We will ensure we create a low-carbon economy at the lowest cost
for consumers.
We will:
- Make saving energy a top infrastructure priority, stimulating
private sector demand with our new Electricity Demand
Reduction market, new market-shaping energy efficiency
standards, support for industry, particularly SMEs, and a
programme of tax incentives and public investment. Our plans for
insulating homes are set out in more detail in Section 7.5, below.
- Stimulate a minimum of £100 billion more private investment in


low-carbon energy infrastructure by 2020.
- Set a legally binding decarbonisation target range for 2030 for the
power sector of 50–100g of CO2 per kWh, which can largely be
achieved by expansion of renewables, with an indicative target
of 60% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. We will
support investment in energy storage and smart grid technology
to enable this higher reliance on renewables.
- Work with the independent regulator Ofgem to ensure the costs
of electricity distribution and transmission infrastructure are
allocated efficiently and fairly between consumers and generators
across the country, and develop more European electricity
interconnection capacity.
- Regulate to end the use of unabated coal in electricity generation
by 2025 because of its high carbon emissions and impact on local
air quality, and require any new gas stations built after 2030 to be
fitted with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. We will
implement a second phase of CCS projects by 2020.
- Expand community energy, building on Britain’s first ever
community energy strategy with additional financial and
regulatory support. We will encourage Councils to be proactive in
delivering energy saving and electricity generation.
- Encourage onshore wind in appropriate locations, helping
meet our climate targets at least cost. We will end ideologically
motivated interference in local planning decisions for wind farms
by Government Ministers.
- Accept that new nuclear power stations can play a role in low-carbon 


electricity supply provided concerns about safety,
disposal of waste and cost are adequately addressed and without
public subsidy for new build.
- Use biomass primarily for heating and small-scale power
generation, act to encourage the wider use of biogas and argue
for the reform of EU policies on biofuels and biomass which help
drive deforestation, including ending all support for food-crop-based
biofuels after 2020.
- Continue to back new entrants to the energy market, smart
meters and faster switching to promote proper competition,
aiming for at least 30% of the household market to be supplied by
competitors to the ‘Big 6’ by 2020.
The UK has significant stores of unconventional gas, which could
be accessed through the process known as fracking. It is vital
that efforts to access this gas be properly regulated to protect
our natural environment. Liberal Democrats in government
have introduced the world’s most robust regulatory regime for
unconventional gas, including banning drilling in National Parks, and
will take two further steps to ensure any shale gas contributes to a
faster transition to a low-carbon economy.
We will:
- Establish a Low-carbon Transition Fund using 50% of any tax
revenues from shale gas to fund energy efficiency, community
energy, low-carbon innovation and renewable heat.
- Require that once a shale gas well is finished, it must be offered
at no cost to geothermal heat developers, to enable faster
expansion of this renewable technology.
- An open, trading nation
As a major global economy, we must promote open markets and
free trade, both within the European Union and beyond. Only as
a full member of a reformed European Union can we be certain
Britain’s businesses will have access to markets in Europe and
beyond.
Liberal Democrats believe we should welcome talented people
from abroad, encourage visitors and tourists who contribute
enormously to our economic growth, and give sanctuary to refugees
fleeing persecution. Immigration procedures must be robust and fair,
and the UK must remain open to visitors who boost our economy,
and migrant workers who play a vital role in business and public
services.


We will:
- Remain a committed member of the EU so we can complete the
Single Market in areas including online industries, the energy
market and services, and help negotiate EU international trade
agreements, opening opportunities for British businesses.
- Support Single Market disciplines in relation to competition and
state aid rules while creating a stronger public interest test for
takeovers in research-intensive activities.
- Continue to allow high-skill immigration to support key sectors of
the economy, and ensure work, tourist and family visit visas are
processed quickly and efficiently.
- Ensure the UK is an attractive destination for overseas students,
not least those who wish to study STEM subjects (Science,
Technology, Engineering and Maths). We will reinstate post-study
work visas for STEM graduates who can find graduate-level
employment within six months of completing their degree.
Tourism and heritage collectively make up as much as 9% of our
economy, and yet these industries do not have the status they
deserve in government or in wider society. We will work to make
sure the British tourism industry is able to compete with other major
world destinations and be a key generator of growth in the UK
economy.
We will:
- Strengthen the Hospitality and Tourism Council, with the Business
and Culture Secretaries as co-chairs.
- Give higher status to tourism within the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport.
- Build on our successful Tourism North and Tourism South West
initiatives to devolve more power, resources and decision-making
to local areas to promote their unique tourism propositions in the
UK and globally.
- Securing global leadership in technology
The UK has a competitive advantage in key sectors of the modern
economy that have the capacity to transform our lives. The UK’s
digital sector is growing at a rate of over 10% a year, employing
nearly 1.5m people. 15% of all new companies last year were
digital companies. We need to support this important sector of our
economy. We will:


- Complete the rollout of high-speed broadband, to reach almost
every household (99.9%) in the UK as well as small businesses in
both rural and urban areas.
- Build on the success of Tech City, Tech North and the Cambridge
tech cluster with a network across the UK acting as incubators for
technology companies.
- Support fast-growing businesses that could create a million jobs
over 20 years, following the Sherry Coutu report into these
‘Scale- Ups’.
- Promote the take up of STEM subjects in schools, retain coding
on the National Curriculum and encourage entrepreneurship at
all levels.
- Maintain and develop the award-winning Government Digital
Service, and the principle of Digital by Default in public services,
pressing ahead with plans to extend this to local government.
- Continue to release government data sets that can facilitate
economic growth in an open and accessible format, including on
standards in public services.


- Ensure the technology implications of government activity
are properly considered by introducing Technology Impact
Assessments into the policy design process.
- Develop cutting-edge digital skills courses for young people
and the unemployed, working with private sector employers and
education and training providers.
- Pride in creativity
Liberal Democrats understand that arts, creative industries and
culture are crucial to Britain’s success and essential for personal
fulfilment and quality of life. The UK’s creative sector has been one
of the great success stories of the past five years, and a critical
driver of our recovery. We are proud of the arts in Britain and will
support them properly, working to deliver access for all, regardless
of income, ethnicity, gender, age, belief, sexuality or disability. We
believe the arts have an essential role in our education system and
will work to encourage creativity in our schools and universities.
We will:
- Maintain free access to national museums and galleries, while
giving these institutions greater autonomy.
- Protect the independence of the BBC while ensuring the Licence
Fee does not rise faster than inflation, maintain Channel 4 in public
ownership and protect the funding and editorial independence of
Welsh language broadcasters.
- Support growth in the creative industries, including video
gaming, by continuing to support the Creative Industries Council,
promoting creative skills, supporting modern and flexible patent,
copyright and licensing rules, and addressing the barriers to
finance faced by small creative businesses.


- Real help for family finances
Tax, welfare, pensions and consumer rights
A fair society is one in which everyone has the
means to get by and the chance to get on. We
will continue to rebalance the tax system away
from hard work and towards unearned wealth,
while stamping out abusive tax avoidance.
We will increase availability of childcare to help
parents who want to work. We will continue to
reform welfare and get people the right support
in Jobcentres. We will build on our world-leading
reforms to the pensions system. And we will fight
tirelessly for a better deal for consumers, in the
private and public sectors.


Liberal Democrats believe Britain should be more equal, and have
worked in government to cut taxes for people on low and middle
incomes, putting money back in the pockets of millions of people.
We have improved childcare support, reformed benefits to make
sure work pays and improved back-to-work support. And we have
freed up pension savings to give older people more choice about
how to manage their money in retirement.
We will continue to rebalance the tax system away from hard
work and towards unearned wealth, while stamping out abusive tax
avoidance. We will increase availability of childcare to help parents
who want to work. We will continue to reform welfare and get people
the right support in Jobcentres. We will build on our world-leading
reforms to the pensions system. And we will fight tirelessly for a
better deal for consumers, in the private and public sectors.


- Fair taxes
During this Parliament we have gone even further than our manifesto
pledge to raise the personal Income Tax threshold to £10,000 a year.
This April’s increase to £10,600 has lifted more than three million
people out of Income Tax altogether and delivered a tax cut of more
than £800 for millions of low and middle-income taxpayers.
We will continue to make taxes fairer and simpler, help those on
low and middle incomes, and ensure those on the highest incomes
make a fair contribution.
- Raise the Personal Allowance to at
least £12,500, cutting your taxes by
around £400 more
- Legislate to make the ‘triple lock’
permanent, guaranteeing decent
pensions rises each year
- Extend free childcare to all two-year
olds, and to the children of
working families from the end of
paid parental leave
- Expand Shared Parental Leave
with a ‘use it or lose it’ month for
fathers, and introduce a right to
paid leave for carers
- Make sure it pays to work by rolling
out Universal Credit, and invest
in back-to-work and healthcare
support for those who need it
- An £800 tax cut for low and middle
income earners, delivered by letting
you earn £10,600 tax free
- Secured the biggest ever cash rise in
the state pension with our ‘triple lock’
policy on uprating
- Cut the cost of childcare with more
free hours for three and four-year
olds, and help for disadvantaged
two- year olds too.
- Helped people balance work and
family life with Shared Parental Leave
and the Right to Request flexible
working for all
- Kept welfare spending under control,
while blocking plans to cut off young
people’s benefits
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More


We will:
- Raise the tax-free Personal Allowance to at least £12,500 by
the end of the next Parliament, putting around £400 back in the
pockets of millions of working people and pensioners. We will
bring forward the planned increase to an £11,000 allowance to
April 2016.
- Consider, as a next step, and once the Personal Allowance rise
is delivered, raising the employee National Insurance threshold
to the Income Tax threshold, as resources allow, while protecting
low earners’ ability to accrue pension and benefit entitlements.
- Ensure those with the highest incomes and wealth are making
a fair contribution. We have identified a series of distortions,
loopholes and excess reliefs that should be removed, raising
money to contribute to deficit reduction. These include reforms
to Capital Gains Tax and Dividend Tax relief, refocusing
Entrepreneurs’ Relief and a supplementary Corporation Tax for
the banking sector. In addition, we will introduce a UK-wide High
Value Property Levy on residential properties worth over
£2 million. It will have a banded structure, like Council Tax.
- Take tough action against corporate tax evasion and avoidance,
including by:
- Setting a target for HM Revenue and Customs to reduce
the tax gap and continuing to invest in staff to enable them
to meet it.
- Introducing a general anti-avoidance rule which would
outlaw contrived structures designed purely or largely to
avoid tax.
- Implementing the planned new offence of corporate
failure to prevent economic crime, including tax evasion,
with penalties for directors up to and including custodial
sentences.
- Levying penalties on firms proven to facilitate tax evasion,
equivalent to the amount of tax evaded by their clients.
- Asking the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee
to consider the approach to paying tax taken by banks for
themselves, their employees and for their customers, as
part of their assessment of the risks posed by the sector,
supported by an annual report by HMRC.
- Restrict access to non-domiciled status, increasing the charges
paid to adopt this status and ending the ability to inherit it.
- Help with childcare costs
Many parents want to take significant time out from work to care for
young children but in many families both parents want or have to


work, and the costs of childcare are prohibitive.
We have made dramatic improvements over the current
Parliament – with Tax-Free Childcare, increases in childcare support
through the benefit system and more free childcare hours for two,
three and four-year olds. But we need to do more so that all who
want to work can do so.
We will:
- Commit to an ambitious goal of 20 hours’ free childcare a week
for all parents with children aged from two to four-years, and all
working parents from the end of paid parental leave (nine months)
to two years. This will not only help parents afford to work, it will
help all children start school confident, happy and ready to learn.
- Start by providing 15 hours a week of free childcare to the parents
of all two-year olds. We will then prioritise 15 hours free childcare
for all working parents with children aged between nine months
and two years.
- Complete the introduction of Tax-Free Childcare, which will
provide up to £2,000 of childcare support for each child and
include childcare support in Universal Credit, refunding 85% of
childcare costs so work pays for low earners.
- Creating jobs and helping people find work
More people are working in the UK today than ever before. Our
economic plans have created more jobs than anyone forecast.
But that does not make it easy for everyone to find work. Liberal
Democrats inherited a benefit system that trapped millions on out-of-work benefits, because it simply did not pay to be in work. Our
reforms are starting to change that but we need to go further.
We will:
- Complete the introduction of Universal Credit (UC), so people are
always better off in work. We will review UC to address any issues
regarding ‘cliff edges’, and ensure increased working hours are
properly incentivised for all claimants. We will retain the overall
cap on a household’s benefits and believe this should continue to
be set at around the average family income.
- Deliver a reformed and improved Work Programme in partnership
with English local government, and the national governments
of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. By devolving this
support we can ensure help and training are more tailored to
local employment markets and better integrated with other
services. We will improve incentives for Jobcentre staff and


Work Programme providers to ensure there is real help for those
furthest from the labour market.
- Establish a review of effective ways to promote ‘rainy day’ saving
to improve people’s financial resilience, and reform hardship
payments, making it easier for people to bring forward part of
their benefit payments to deal with emergencies.
- Develop a package of specialist support for carers seeking part-time
work or a return to full-time employment.
- Review sanctions procedures in Jobcentres. While sanctions
can be a necessary last resort to ensure jobseekers are looking
for work, they should not be used to cut benefit expenditure
deliberately. Reductions in benefits may not always be the best
way to improve claimants’ compliance: those with chaotic lives
might be more successful in finding a job if they were directed to
targeted support with their problems. We will ensure there are no
league tables or targets for sanctions issued by Jobcentres and
introduce a ‘yellow card’ warning so people are only sanctioned if
they deliberately and repeatedly break the rules.
Liberal Democrats will protect young people’s entitlements to the
welfare safety net, while getting them the help they need to get their
first job. That means doubling the number of businesses that hire
apprentices. It also means providing support that has been proven
to work, like work experience placements that help them get a first
foot on the career ladder. These placements should be tailored for
those with disabilities or mental health problems and those with
parental responsibilities and we will work to expand the availability of
placements into new sectors including manufacturing, science and
technology.
- Making welfare work
Working-age benefits make up a significant proportion of public
spending, and have long been in need of reform, which we have
started in this Parliament. Through tough choices, we have found
savings in the welfare budget and we must continue to do so as
we balance the books. However, we do not support proposals for
a lengthy freeze to working age benefits, and we will not protect
benefits for the wealthiest pensioners at the expense of people
working on low wages.
Our priority is to tackle the causes of rising benefit bills – high
rents, low pay, sickness and unemployment.
We will:
- Introduce a 1% cap on the uprating of working-age benefits until


the budget is balanced in 2017/18, after which they will rise with
inflation once again. Disability and parental leave benefits will be
exempt from this temporary cap.
- Encourage landlords to lower their rent by paying them Housing
Benefit directly, with tenants’ consent, in return for a fixed
reduction. Our plans for a major expansion of house building and
new ‘family friendly’ tenancies, which limit annual rent increases,
will also help reduce upward pressure on rents. We will review the
way the Shared Accommodation Rate in Local Housing Allowance
is set, and review the Broad Rental Market Areas to ensure they fit
with realistic travel patterns.
- Improve links between Jobcentres and Work Programme
providers and the local NHS to ensure all those in receipt of
health-related benefits are getting the care and support to which
they are entitled. In particular, as we expand access to talking
therapies we expect many more people to recover and be able to
seek work again.
- Work with Local Authorities to tackle fraud and error in a more


coordinated way, in particular on Housing Benefit.
- Help everyone in work on a low wage step up the career
ladder and increase their hours, reducing their need for
benefits, with tailored in-work careers and job search advice.
- Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment and free
TV Licence from pensioners who pay tax at the higher rate
(40%). We will retain the free bus pass for all pensioners.
- Flexibility at work and fair pay
Britain’s employment laws are among the best in the world,
balancing the needs of business for flexibility with the rights
of staff to fair treatment. Nonetheless there are still too many
examples of low pay, exploitation, and bad practice, which
contribute to unacceptable levels of inequality in our society.
This has to change: the more people earn a decent wage, the
fewer will be dependent on benefits or stuck in poverty.
We will:
- Encourage employers to provide more flexible working,
expanding Shared Parental Leave with an additional ‘use it
or lose it’ month to encourage fathers to take time off with
young children. While changes to parental leave should
be introduced slowly to give business time to adjust, our
ambition is to see Paternity and Shared Parental Leave
become a ‘day one’ right.
- Ensure swift implementation of the new rules requiring
companies with more than 250 employees to publish
details of the different pay levels of men and women in their
organisation. We will build on this platform and, by 2020,
extend transparency requirements to include publishing the
number of people paid less than the Living Wage and the
ratio between top and median pay. We will also consult on
requirements for companies to conduct and publish a full
equality pay review, and to consult staff on executive pay.
- Ask the Low Pay Commission to look at ways of raising the
National Minimum Wage, without damaging employment
opportunities. We will improve enforcement action and clamp
down on abuses by employers seeking to avoid paying
the minimum wage by reviewing practices such as unpaid
internships.
- Establish an independent review to consult on how to set a
fair Living Wage across all sectors. We will pay this Living
Wage in all central government departments and their
agencies from April 2016, and encourage other public sector


employers to do likewise.
- Improve the enforcement of employment rights, reviewing
Employment Tribunal fees to ensure they are not a barrier. We will
ensure employers cannot avoid giving their staff rights or paying
the minimum wage by wrongly classifying them as workers or
self-employed.
Liberal Democrats understand that flexible employment contracts –
including Zero Hours contracts – can work well for employees and
businesses. But that is not always the case and we will continue
to stamp out abuse. We will create a formal right to request a fixed
contract and consult on introducing a right to make regular patterns
of work contractual after a period of time.
- Improving support for the hardest to help
For too long, sickness benefits were used as a way of parking
people away from the unemployment statistics. Our aim is to
get everyone the support and help they need, both financially
and in terms of advice and support. That does require a formal
assessment: but these tests have to be fair and should not be an
extra burden for vulnerable people. That is why we have made
many improvements to the assessments introduced by the last
government.
We want to aim even higher, ensuring assessments are truly fair,
with quick access to financial help for those who cannot work, and
support for those who can.
We will:
- Conduct a review of the Work Capability Assessment and
Personal Independence Payment assessments to ensure they are
fair, accurate and timely and evaluate the merits of a public sector
provider.
- Invest to clear any backlog in assessments for Disability Living
Allowance and Personal Independence Payment.
- Simplify and streamline back-to-work support for people with
disabilities, mental or physical health problems. We will aim for
the goal of one assessment and one budget for disabled and sick
people to give them more choice and control.
- Raise awareness of, and seek to expand, Access to Work, which
supports people with disabilities in work.
- Reform the policy to remove the spare room subsidy. Existing
social tenants will not be subject to any housing benefit
reduction until they have been offered reasonable alternative
accommodation. We will ensure tenants who need an extra


bedroom for genuine medical reasons are entitled to one in any
assessment of their Housing Benefit needs, and those whose
homes are substantially adapted do not have their Housing
Benefit reduced.
- Help to save for and enjoy your retirement
Life expectancy is increasing. This is obviously good news, but it
brings challenges; older people may need a pension income that will
last for 20, 30 or even 40 years.
We want to build on the world-leading reforms Liberal Democrats
in government have introduced since 2010. We have abolished the
default retirement ages so older people cannot be forced out of
work on grounds of age. We have reversed decades of decline in
pensioner incomes by uprating the state pension in line with our
‘triple lock’ guarantee. We have introduced a new single tier pension
to make saving simple. We have auto-enrolled five million people
into a pension for the first time. And we have scrapped the rules that
dictated how you receive your pension, so now you can spend your
savings as you see fit.
We want Britain to be the best place in the world to save for, and
enjoy, your retirement.
We will:
- Continue the introduction of our simpler single tier pension so
people can plan ahead securely, and feel the benefit of every
pound they save.
- Legislate for the Liberal Democrat ‘triple lock’ of increasing the
State Pension each year by the highest of earnings growth, prices
growth or 2.5%.
- Ensure pensioners are eligible to gain from the increased
Personal Allowance of £12,500.
- Improve workplace pensions and continue to auto-enrol workers,
completing the rollout of this scheme in full and on time. We will
crack down on charges and encourage people to save more into
their pension pot through this scheme.
- Press ahead with plans to allow people more freedom in the use
of their pension pots and to allow existing pensioners to sell their
annuity.
- Establish a review to consider the case for, and practical
implications of, introducing a single rate of tax relief for pensions,
which would be designed to be simpler and fairer and which
would be set more generously than the current 20% basic rate
relief.


- Protecting consumers and keeping bills low
Confident consumers encourage innovation and competition,
which strengthen our economy. We have radically overhauled
consumer rights law, making it simpler and clearer and for the
first time protecting consumers buying digital content. We have
driven competition in the energy sector, speeded up switching, and
simplified tariffs so customers can always get the best deal. We
have ended the era of above-inflation rail fare increases. We have
clamped down on unscrupulous payday lenders and strengthened
protections for vulnerable consumers against rogue traders. In the
next Parliament we want to go further.
We will:
- Force energy companies to allow customers to change to any
cheaper supplier in just 24 hours, and extend the principle of
‘gainer led’ switching, where your new provider organises your
switch for you, into new sectors, including telecoms.
- Give people easier to understand information about their own
energy use, with appropriate privacy protections, with a national
rollout of smart electricity and gas meters. We will guarantee that
anyone on a prepayment meter can choose a smart meter instead
by 2017.
- Help people form new energy cooperatives so they can benefit
from group discounts and cut their bills.
- Protect high streets and consumers by granting new powers
to Local Authorities to reduce the proliferation of betting shops
and substantially reducing the maximum stakes for Fixed Odds
Betting Terminals.
- Ensure rail fares rise no faster than inflation over the Parliament as
a whole.
- Require the Sports Ground Safety Authority to prepare guidance
under which domestic football clubs, working with their
supporters, may introduce safe standing areas.
- Continue and expand the midata project into new sectors, giving
consumers the right to access data businesses hold on them in
an open and reusable format.
- Driving up standards in public services
Citizens expect a good service from their public services, and
rightly so. While many schools, hospitals, libraries and other public
institutions offer world-class standards, we could do so much


better: integrating services and making them more accessible, as
well as improving the response when things go wrong.
Liberal Democrats value the important role the voluntary,
independent and community sectors play in the life of our
communities and in delivering public services. To ensure all
providers of public services are accountable to their users and the
public, a public authority (if possible a democratically accountable
one) should always take the decision about whether a service should
be provided or commissioned.
We will:
- Improve consumer protections in public services, with a review of
complaints handling processes, exploring the options of mirroring
the private sector ‘super-complaint’ system in the public sector
and reforms to the current system of ombudsmen.
- Introduce a ‘community trigger’ mechanism to enable the public
to require a review of the provision of a particular service being
delivered consistently poorly.
- Extend Freedom of Information laws to cover private companies
delivering public services.
- Work with Local Authorities to bring services together at a local
level to provide a better service to citizens, and support users in
pooling their personal budgets into mutual support arrangements.
- Continue and expand the What Works Network to promote
evidence-based policy making, establish an incubator for social
enterprises developing innovative solutions to policy problems
and expand the use of public competitions to encourage
innovation in public services.
- Require the highest standards of data protection by public service
providers, including requiring that where data is used for research
purposes it must be anonymised wherever possible, and impose
a moratorium on the creation of new government databases
without Parliamentary authority.


- An opportunity society
World-class education for all
Liberal Democrats have put education at the
heart of our agenda for a generation. We believe
every child deserves a great start in life, and
are determined to make sure that the education
system finds and nurtures the best in everyone.
This is essential in order to break down the
unfair divisions in our society, and to ensure a
productive, competitive economy.


Liberal Democrats have put education at the heart of our agenda for
a generation. We believe every child deserves a great start in life,
and are determined to make sure that the education system finds
and nurtures the best in everyone. This is essential in order to break
down the unfair divisions in our society, and to ensure a productive,
competitive economy.
Too many people have their chances in life determined by who
their parents are, rather than by their own efforts and abilities. With
our Pupil Premium, investing in children who might otherwise fall
behind, we are finally tackling the scandalous gap in exam results
between rich and poor, but we must do even more.
Children start learning from the moment they are born, so parents
need to be supported right from the start. Our plan stretches from
cradle to college: high-quality early years education; qualified
teachers and successful schools in every community; more money
helping the children who need it most; flexible choices for teenagers
and young people; and world-class training at college and university
to set every young adult on the path to a fulfilled working life.


- Protect early years, school, sixth
form and college budgets –
investment from nursery to 19 to
raise standards for all
- Parents’ Guarantee: core
curriculum in every school and
every child taught by qualified
teachers
- End illiteracy and innumeracy by
2025, with action in nurseries to
get all 4 year olds ready for school
by 2020
- Extend free school meals to all
primary pupils
- Double the numbers of businesses
hiring apprentices, and give young
people aged 16–21 a discount bus
pass to cut the cost of travel
- Protection for school budgets and
new Pupil Premium cash for your
local school to help children who
might otherwise fall behind
- A million more children now taught in
good or outstanding schools
- Driven up standards and narrowed
the attainment gap between rich and
poor children
- Free school meals for the youngest
children in primary school
- Two million apprenticeships, training
our young people for 21st century
jobs, and record numbers going to
university
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- High-quality early years education
If we want a more equal society, we must get help to all those who
might fall behind, and their parents, right from the start. That means
improving early education and protecting the wide range of family
support services offered in Children’s Centres. We must improve
the quality of early years teaching, and raise the status of those who
work in early years.
We will:
- Raise the quality of early years provision and ensure that by 2020
every formal early years setting employs at least one person


Under the Liberal Democrats the proportion of pupils in
good and outstanding schools increased from 66% to 79%
– that's a million more pupils getting a good education.


who holds an Early Years Teacher qualification. Working with
organisations like Teach First, we will recruit more staff with Early
Years Qualified status, and extend full Qualified Teacher status,
terms and conditions to all those who are properly trained.
- Increase our Early Years Pupil Premium – which gives early
years settings extra money to help children from disadvantaged
backgrounds – to £1,000 per pupil per year.
- Continue to support Local Authorities in providing Children’s
Centres, especially in areas of high need, encouraging integration
with other community services like health visitors, and in
particular reviewing the support and advice available for parents
on early child nutrition and breastfeeding.
- Improve the identification of Special Educational Needs and
disability at the earliest possible stage, so targeted support can
be provided and primary schools are better prepared for their
intake of pupils.
- Driving up school standards
There is much to be proud of in our schools today, and much that has
been improved in the last few years. But far too many children are still
failing to get the qualifications they need. The gaps between rich and
poor are still too wide. We cannot fail our children – especially when we
know it is the children who need the most help who are the most likely
to be let down.
We will:
- Protect the education budget in real terms from the early years to
age 19. We will at least protect the schools’ Pupil Premium in real
terms, consider carefully the merits of extending the Premium, and
introduce a fair National Funding Formula.
- Set a clear ambition for all children to achieve a good grasp of Maths
and English, aiming to eradicate child illiteracy and innumeracy by
2025. We will set an interim goal that all children should start school
with good language skills by 2020.
- Strengthen school leadership and governance. We will provide rapid
support and intervention to help ensure that all schools become
good or outstanding. Our Talented Head Teachers programme will
expand, helping move top leaders to where they are most needed.
- Increase the number of Teaching Schools – centres of teaching
excellence that provide support to other schools.
- Ensure there is an effective, democratically accountable, ‘middle tier’
to support and intervene in schools where problems are identified.
We will encourage local head teachers with a strong record to play
a key role in school improvement through a local Head Teacher


Board, working with schools and Local Authorities. We will abolish
unelected Regional Schools Commissioners.
- Allow Ofsted to inspect both Local Authorities and academy chains.
Local authorities and academy chains which are failed by Ofsted for
intervention work will be required to work with stronger organisations
or be replaced.
- Rule out state-funded profit-making schools.
- Give democratically accountable Local Authorities clear
responsibility for local school places planning. We will only fund
new mainstream schools in areas where school places are needed,
and repeal the rule that all new state funded schools must be free
schools or academies. We will allow Local Authorities to select the
school sponsor, where this is not the Local Authority itself.
- Ensure a fair local schools admissions process.
- Implement the Children’s Commissioner’s report They Go The Extra
Mile into the prevention of and positive alternatives to exclusion, and
strengthen appeals panels.
- Extend free school meals to all children in primary education as
resources allow and following a full evaluation of free meals for
infants.
- Continue to promote the local integration of health, care and
educational support for children with Special Educational Needs and
health problems.
We will allow parents to continue to choose faith-based schools
within the state-funded sector and allow the establishment of new
faith schools. We will ensure all faith schools develop an inclusive
admissions policy and end unfair discrimination on grounds of faith
when recruiting staff, except for those principally responsible for
optional religious instruction.
- World-class teaching
Great teachers are at the heart of a successful education system.
We will continue our work to attract the best into the profession and
support teachers throughout their careers.
We want to build the status of the teaching profession, support
and nurture teachers in their work, and so drive up standards in
every school.
We will:
- Guarantee all teachers in state-funded schools will be fully
qualified or working towards Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) from
September 2016.


- Introduce a clear and properly funded entitlement to professional
development for all teachers. We will raise the bar for entry to
the profession, requiring a B grade minimum in GCSE Maths and
English, allowing us to abolish the separate Maths and English
tests.
- Help establish a new profession-led Royal College of Teachers,
eventually to oversee Qualified Teacher Status and professional
development. We do not believe Ministers should dictate teaching
practice and will not issue instructions about how to structure the
school day or what kind of lessons to conduct.
- Continue to support the Teach First programme to attract high
calibre graduates into teaching, in particular in STEM subjects.
- Tackle unnecessary teacher workload, including by:
- Avoiding policy changes while children are within a key
stage.
- Establishing the right accountability framework for schools.
- Ensuring Ofsted inspections are high-quality, fair to all
schools and focus on outcomes and not processes.
- Establish a new National Leadership Institute to promote high-quality
leadership and help the best leaders into the most
challenging schools.
- Continue to work with the Education Endowment Foundation
to establish a comprehensive evidence base on what works
in teaching, including assessing play-based learning in early
education, and tackling the attainment gap.
We need to encourage and inspire more children to study STEM
subjects. At primary level we will encourage schools to have at least
one science specialist among the staff, and at secondary level work
to maximise the number of teachers who have degree qualifications
in the subjects they teach.
- Curriculum and qualifications
We want schools to have flexibility and freedom, but we also
believe that both parents and children need to know that the school
curriculum will cover the essentials, and that teachers will be skilled
educators who know how to inspire a love of learning.
That is why we have developed our Parents’ Guarantee: every
child will be taught by qualified teachers, and the core curriculum
will be taught at every state-funded school. We want the highest
standards in our schools, and will ensure that every child has a
thorough grasp of the basics. But we also understand that a great
education is about more than just learning facts: creativity should
be nurtured, children should be helped to develop the life skills they


will need as adults, and every pupil should be given advice and
guidance about their future.
We will:
- Establish an independent Educational Standards Authority (ESA)
entirely removed from Ministerial interference. The ESA will have
responsibility for curriculum content and examination standards.
- Introduce a minimum curriculum entitlement – a slimmed down
core national curriculum, which will be taught in all state-funded
schools. This will include Personal, Social and Health Education:
a ‘curriculum for life’ including financial literacy, first aid and
emergency lifesaving skills, citizenship, and age-appropriate sex
and relationship education. To ensure all children learn about a
wide range of religious and nonreligious world views, religious
education will be included in the core curriculum; however we will
give schools the freedom to set policy on whether to hold acts
of collective worship, while ensuring any such acts are strictly
optional.
- Complete the introduction of reformed GCSEs, while continuing
to oppose Conservative plans for a return to the old O-level/CSE
divide.
- Improve the quality of vocational education, including skills for
entrepreneurship and self-employment, and improve careers
advice in schools and colleges.
- Improving care for looked after children
Liberal Democrats have long championed early intervention to
prevent problems before they arise, but we also need to make sure
we equip social workers with the skills to address these complex
issues and ensure children’s safety. Where children do have to be
taken into care we must make sure they find a loving home with
as little disruption and instability as possible. We have done much
in Government to be proud of in helping children in care and to
improve social work, but we can still go further.
We will:
- Continue to invest in early intervention, further expanding the
Troubled Families Programme and building on the work of the
Early Intervention Foundation to spread evidence of what works.
- Expect Local Authorities to set out a clear purpose for the care
system: to promote emotional wellbeing and resilience, provide
a secure base on which children can be supported in their
development and provide individually tailored help with recovery.


- Raise the quality and profile of children’s social work, continuing
and expanding the Frontline programme – which is fast-tracking
the brightest and best into the profession – to at least 300
graduate recruits each year.
- Tackle delay and instability in foster care, with better support and
training for foster carers, including on mental health issues.
- Continue to make it easier for children in care to find a loving
home, through the national Adoption Register and the new
national gateway for adoption, a first point of contact for potential
adopters.
- Prevent looked after children and young people being drawn into
the criminal justice system unnecessarily by promoting restorative
justice.
- Improving support for young adults
We want young people to face the future with optimism and
confidence. The education leaving age has now risen to 18, but as
children grow, their independence grows too, and the support that
education and youth services provide to them and their families
needs to adapt. Whether it is supporting people with the costs of
travel to college or apprenticeships, or promoting positive images of
young people by celebrating their successes: Liberal Democrats are
on the side of the next generation.
We will:
- Work to introduce a new Young Person’s Discount Card, for
young people aged 16–21, giving a 2/3rds discount on bus
travel, as resources allow. This will assist all bus users by helping
maintain the viability of existing bus routes and making it easier to
open new ones.
- Enable government departments, local Councils and private
businesses to add discount offers to the Young Person’s Discount
Card.
- Review access to transport for students and apprentices in rural
areas where no scheduled services may be available.
- Develop an NHS ‘student guarantee’, making it easier for students
to get care and support while at university, particularly those with
long-term health conditions or caring responsibilities.
- Promote social action and volunteering at school, college and university
and work to raise the status of youth work and youth workers.
- Improve links between employers and schools, encouraging all
schools to participate in mentoring schemes and programmes
that seek to raise aspiration like Speakers for Schools and


Inspiring The Future. In particular, we will seek to inspire more
children and young people to follow technical and scientific
careers through partnership with relevant businesses.
- A world class university sector, open to all
Liberal Democrats have ensured that no undergraduate student in
England has to pay a penny up front of their tuition fees. Students
in England do not have to pay anything until they are earning over
£21,000 per year – a figure which will increase in line with earnings
– and over that income, monthly repayments are linked to earnings.
This means only high-earning graduates pay their tuition fees in full.
We now have the highest university application rates ever, including
from disadvantaged students.
But we need to ensure higher education is accessible to all those
who can benefit, including at postgraduate level. Liberal Democrats
in government secured the first ever income-contingent loans
scheme for graduate degrees, which we will protect and seek to
extend.
We will:
- Ensure that all universities work to widen participation across the
sector, prioritising early intervention in schools and colleges. This
will include running summer schools and setting up mentoring
programmes between students or alumni and school pupils.
- Require universities to be transparent about their selection
criteria.
- Work with university ‘mission groups’ to develop a comprehensive
credit accumulation and transfer framework to help students
transfer between and within institutions, enable more part-time
learning, and help more people to complete qualifications.
- Improve the Key Information Set and explore the option of
a standardised student contract. We will legislate to reform
regulation of the higher education sector, improving student
protection.
- Establish a review of higher education finance within the next
Parliament to consider any necessary reforms, in the light of the
latest evidence of the impact of the existing financing system
on access, participation (including of low-income groups) and
quality. The review will cover undergraduate and postgraduate
courses, with an emphasis on support for living costs for
students, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds.


- Expanding and improving apprenticeships
and further education
More people have started an apprenticeship in this Parliament than
ever before. As we grow our economy, we must protect and enhance
adult skills training and our further education colleges. We need to
grow our skill base, especially in the technologies and industries that
are most important to our economic future. We want it to become
the norm for businesses to take on and train up young people as
apprentices in every sector of our economy, and for higher level
apprenticeships to be understood as a respected alternative to
university education.
We will:
- Increase the number of apprenticeships and improve their
quality, extending the Apprenticeship Grant for Employers for
the remainder of the next Parliament, delivering 200,000 grants
to employers and expanding the number of degree-equivalent
Higher Apprenticeships.
- Aim to double the number of businesses which hire apprentices,
including by extending them to new sectors of our economy, like
creative and digital industries.
- Develop National Colleges as national centres of expertise for key
sectors, like renewable energy, to deliver the high-level vocational
skills that businesses need.
- Establish a cross-party commission to secure a long-term
settlement for the public funding of reskilling and lifelong learning.
- Set up a review into the VAT treatment of Sixth Form Colleges
and FE Colleges to ensure fair treatment in relation to the schools
sector.
- Work with the Apprenticeship Advisory Group to increase
the number of apprentices from BAME backgrounds, ensure
gender balance across industry sectors, and encourage
underrepresented groups to apply.
- Identify and seek to solve skills gaps like the lack of advanced
technicians by expanding higher vocational training like
foundation degrees, Higher National Diplomas, Higher National
Certificates and Higher Apprenticeships.


- Building a healthier society
Protecting the NHS and improving health
Good health is one of the most important assets
we can have in life, and we must do all we can to
help people stay healthy, as well as provide high-quality
care when they are ill. Our NHS is the
envy of the world, and we will fund it properly,
ending the discrimination against mental health
which has existed for too long, and delivering
equal care.


Good health is one of the most important assets we can have in life,
and we must do all we can to help people stay healthy, as well as
provide high-quality care when they are ill.
Our NHS is the envy of the world, and we will fund it properly,
ending the discrimination against mental health which has existed
for too long, and delivering equal care.
As a nation, we are living longer but that means we have more
people living with conditions like cancer, diabetes and dementia who
need care and support to live with dignity and the maximum degree
of independence. We must set the highest standards in care, with
a well-trained and motivated workforce, and get health and care
services to work together without artificial boundaries.
Health and wellbeing are affected by far more than just the quality
of health and care services. Liberal Democrats will act to ensure
that everything government does supports people to improve their
wellbeing: we will work to improve the wider factors that affect our
health like warm homes, good air quality and access to healthy food
so everyone can have the best opportunity to lead a healthy life.


- Deliver the £8 billion England’s
NHS leaders say is needed to keep
it strong, with money for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland too
- Invest £500m to transform mental
health care with waiting time
standards to match those in
physical health care
- Introduce a package of support
for carers including a £250 Carer’s
Bonus every year
- Crack down on bad care, with
better pay and conditions for care
staff and higher standards for all
- Increased the NHS budget every
year in real terms, helping fund nearly
10,000 more doctors and 7,000 more
nurses
- Improved access to talking therapies:
2.6 million patients have been treated
since 2010
- £400m invested to give carers a
break with our respite fund
- Capped the cost of care, so older
people can afford to get the help they
need
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Investing in our NHS
The NHS is our most treasured public service. Liberal Democrats
are committed to the founding principles of the NHS as a taxpayer-funded
system, free at the point of use. To ensure this principle is
maintained even as demand for health care grows, we will give the
NHS the investment it needs. We are the only party with a credible
plan to deliver the extra £8 billion NHS leaders know our health
service in England needs by 2020, with the appropriate boost to
funding for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too.
We will:
- Always ensure access to health care is based on need not ability
to pay and that the NHS remains free at the point of delivery.
- Deliver the money needed for England’s NHS by:
- Continuing real-terms protection of the NHS budget until


we have balanced the books in 2017/18 – with a £1 billion
boost on top of this protection. We made a start towards
this £1 billion increase in the Budget by securing a £250m a
year investment in mental health.
- Increasing NHS spending in line with economic growth
from then on.
- These commitments mean NHS funding in England will be at
least £8 billion higher a year in real terms by 2020. This will lead
to higher funding for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish
governments, too, which Liberal Democrats believe should be
spent on their health services.
- Invest half the initial £1 billion in providing care in people’s own
homes and communities, preventing emergency admissions and
making it easier to discharge people after a hospital stay – and so
relieving pressures on all hospital services.
- Make sure the NHS is funded and organised to carry out
diagnostic tests and necessary treatments in a timely and
effective manner, so that waiting times meet public expectations
without distorting clinical priorities.
- Join up health and care at national level, shifting full responsibility
for care policy and funding to the Department of Health.
To ensure the NHS is safeguarded for the long term we will
commission a non-partisan Fundamental Review of NHS and social
care funding this year. We will involve as many people as possible in
this nationwide consultation.
- Equal care for mental health
One in four of us will experience mental health problems, but for
decades mental health has been the last in the queue for funding
and attention. Mental health problems cost the country as much
as £100 billion each year yet less than a quarter of people with
depression get the treatment they need.
In 2012, we called a halt to this and wrote equality for mental
health into law. We are now making real progress, introducing the
first ever waiting time standards in mental health. We have invested
£400m in increasing access to talking therapies and £150m in help
for people with eating disorders, but there is still a long way to go.
That is why we will increase mental health spending in England’s
NHS by £500m a year by 2016/17 – half of which we delivered in
this year’s Budget – and provide the cash for similar investments in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.


To deliver genuine equality between mental and physical health in the
NHS we will:
- Continue to roll out access and waiting time standards for
children, young people and adults. This will include a waiting time
standard from referral of no more than six weeks for therapy for
depression or anxiety and a two-week wait standard for all young
people experiencing a first episode of psychosis.
- Increase access to clinically and cost-effective talking therapies
so hundreds of thousands more people can get this support. Our
long-term goal is to see everyone who can benefit being treated,
but we will set an interim target of getting 25% of those suffering
into treatment.
- Transform care for pregnant women, new mothers and those who
have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth, and help them get the
early care they need.
- Revolutionise children’s mental health services. With the £250m
a year announced in this year’s Budget we will implement the
proposals outlined in the report of the Government’s Children’s
Mental Health Taskforce. This means building better links with
schools, ensuring all children develop mental resilience, and
getting support and care quickly to those who are struggling. Our
investment will help ensure children can access high-quality care
closer to home.


- Ensure no one in crisis is turned away, with new waiting time
standards and better crisis care in Accident and Emergency
(A&E), in the community and via phone lines. This will enable us to
end the use of police cells for people facing a mental health crisis.
- Radically transform mental health services, extending the use of
personal budgets, integrating care more fully with the rest of the
NHS, introducing rigorous inspection and high-quality standards,
comprehensive collection of data to monitor outcomes and
waiting times and changing the way services are funded so they
do not lose out in funding decisions in future.
- Introduce care navigators so people get help finding their way
around the system, and set stretching standards to improve the
physical health of people with mental health problems.
To improve wellbeing and make the UK more mental health-friendly, we
will:
- Publish a national wellbeing strategy, which puts better health and
wellbeing for all at the heart of government policy. This will cover
all aspects of government policy, including transport, access to
nature, and housing, at national and local level.
- Develop a clear approach on preventing mental illness, with a
public health campaign promoting the steps people can take to
improve their own mental resilience – the wellbeing equivalent of
the ‘Five a Day’ campaign.
- Support good practice among employers in promoting wellbeing
and ensure people with mental health problems get the help they
need to stay in or find work.
- Establish a world-leading mental health research fund, investing
£50m to further our understanding of mental illness and develop
more effective treatments.
- Continue to support the Time to Change programme to tackle
stigma against mental health.
- Ensure all frontline public service professionals, including in
schools and universities, get better training in mental health
– helping them to develop their own mental resilience as well as
learning to identify people with mental health problems.
- Support community services and volunteers working to combat
loneliness, particularly in later life.
- Joining up health and social care
We need services that fit around people’s lives, not ones that force
them to fit their lives around the care they need. This is going to be
increasingly important as our population ages and the number of


people living with long-term conditions continues to grow. It is time
to move away from a fragmented system to an integrated service
with more joined-up care, and more personal budgets so people
can design services for their own individual needs. We believe
this should happen from the bottom up, suiting the needs of local
communities.
We will:
- Secure local agreement on full pooling of budgets between the
NHS and care services with a target date of 2018, consulting on a
legal duty for this. The details of how services are commissioned
will remain a matter for local areas. In this way we will build on the
radical proposals to integrate health and care funding in Greater
Manchester.
- Continue to develop Health and Wellbeing Boards to take a broad
view of how services can improve wellbeing in their area, ensuring
democratic accountability for local care.
- Combine the public health, adult social care and health outcome
frameworks into a single national wellbeing outcomes framework
to ensure the NHS and local government work together towards
common goals.
- Support new joined-up services such as GPs providing services
like scans and blood tests closer to home, or hospitals having GP
surgeries within A&E departments.
- Encourage the development of joined-up health providers,
which cover hospital and community services, including GPs,
learning from international best practice. We will permit NHS
commissioners and providers in a local area to form a single
integrated health organisation where appropriate.
- Work with Monitor to reform NHS funding systems, moving away
from payments for activity to tariffs that encourage joined-up
services and preventive care.
Liberal Democrats are committed to repealing any parts of the Health
and Social Care Act 2012 which make NHS services vulnerable to
forced privatisation through international agreements on free markets
in goods and services. We will end the role of the Competition and
Markets Authority in health, making it clear that the needs of patients,
fairness and access always come ahead of competition, and that
good local NHS services do not have to be put out to tender. After
determined negotiations, we now have a clear guarantee from the EU
that member states’ rights to provide public services directly and not
open them up to competition are explicitly enshrined in the Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and we will ensure this
remains the case for TTIP and any future trade agreements.


- Better access to GPs and community care
Most people’s experience of the NHS is their local GP, or the nurses
and support staff who visit them at home or work in community
clinics. Better access to care in GP surgeries and closer to home is
better for patients and will also help reduce pressure on hospitals,
A&E departments and ambulances.
We will:
- Ensure easier access to GPs, expanding evening and weekend
opening, encouraging phone and Skype appointments,
encouraging GPs to work together in federations, and allowing
people more choice.
- Encourage GPs and other community clinicians to work in
disadvantaged areas though our Patient Premium.
- Better utilise the network of community pharmacists across the
country so they become the first point of contact for advice on
minor illnesses and are joined-up with GPs and community health
teams.
- Encourage health services to link up with Local Authority social
care teams and voluntary services to join up care.
- Review the rules for exemption from prescription charges to
ensure they are fair to those with long-term conditions and
disabilities.
- Aiming higher: following the evidence to
improve health and care
We will set ambitious goals so everything we do in the NHS is
focused on helping people in Britain live longer, healthier, lives. Early
diagnosis is absolutely crucial and can make a life-saving difference,
so we will support screening programmes where these are proven
to be both clinically and cost-effective. It is also vital we invest in
research to develop new treatments and find new ways of delivering
innovative treatments in affordable ways.
We will:
- Set ambitious goals to improve outcomes for the most serious
life-threatening diseases like cancer and long-term conditions like
dementia.
- Work towards a global deal to release significant additional funds for
finding a cure or preventive treatment for dementia, doubling NHS


research spend for this condition by 2020.
- Set clear goals for earlier diagnosis and improved aftercare for
conditions like cancer and heart disease.
- Promote evidence-based ‘social prescribing’ of sport, arts and other
activity to help tackle obesity, mental health problems and other
health conditions, and work to widen the evidence base.
- Continue to introduce evidence-based screening programmes,
encouraging increased participation with informed consent.
- Improve patient safety by updating the laws on regulation of health
professionals and on cosmetic procedures.
- Ensure targets in the NHS are evidence-based and do not distort
clinical priorities.
- Improve support for groups that often face lower standards of care,
such as older people and people with mental health problems or
learning disabilities.
- Get the best for the NHS out of innovative medicines and treatments
while continuing to ensure value for money for the NHS in
negotiations on the cost of medicines, promoting the use of generic
medicines where appropriate.
- Support, including through rules on public funding and research,
moves towards ensuring all clinical trials are registered, with their
methods and summary results reported in public.
We will develop a just settlement for haemophiliacs who were given
contaminated blood, and their families.
- Helping people keep healthy
It is better for patients and for the NHS if we keep people healthy in
the first place, rather than just waiting until people develop illnesses
and come for treatment. This means doing more to promote healthy
eating and exercise, making people aware of the dangers of smoking
and excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs, and helping
to improve mental health and wellbeing.
In government we have taken significant steps, taking tobacco
off display in shops and introducing standardised packaging,
for example. We have also returned the delivery of public health
services to Local Authorities to ensure a more coordinated and
localised approach.
Improving our environment is a vital step to improving people’s
health. By insulating homes we can reduce the number of people
who become unwell because of the cold; by tackling air pollution
we can attack the root causes of many deaths; by opening up more
sports facilities and building more cycle routes we can cut obesity
and reduce heart problems.


We will:
- Support effective public awareness campaigns like Be Clear on
Cancer, working closely with charities to raise awareness of the signs
and symptoms of killer diseases.
- Keep public health within local government, where it is effectively
joined-up with preventive community services.
- Restrict the marketing of junk food to children, including restricting
TV advertising before the 9pm watershed, and maintain the effective
‘Five a Day’ campaign.
- Encourage the traffic light labelling system for food products and
publication of information on calorie, fat, sugar and salt content in
restaurants and takeaways.
- Reduce smoking rates, including by completing the introduction of
standardised packaging for tobacco products. We will introduce
a tax levy on tobacco companies so they fairly contribute to the
costs of health care and smoking cessation services, subject to
consultation on the detailed design and practicalities.
- Carefully monitor the growing evidence base around electronic
cigarettes, which appear to be a route by which many people are
quitting tobacco, and ensure restrictions on marketing and use
are proportionate and evidence-based. For example, we support
restrictions on advertising which risks promoting tobacco or targets
under 18s, such as those introduced in 2014, but would rule out a
statutory ban on ‘vaping’ in public places.
- Introduce Minimum Unit Pricing for alcohol, subject to the outcome
of the legal challenge in Scotland, and support the greater use
of Local Authority powers and criminal behaviour orders to help
communities tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder.
- Pass a Nature Act to increase access to green spaces and a Green
Transport Act to cut air pollution.
- Help for carers
The number of family carers is rising, including in the ‘sandwich
generation’ who find themselves trying to care for their children and
their parents at the same time. Carers are unsung heroes and we
need to do more to help them. We have already invested £400m in
carers’ breaks, but we can and must go further.
We will:
- Introduce an annual Carer’s Bonus of £250 for carers looking after
someone for 35 hours or more each week.
- Work to raise the amount you can earn before losing Carer’s
Allowance from £110 to £150 a week.


- Consult on introducing five days’ paid additional ‘care leave’ a
year for carers who qualify for the Carer’s Allowance.
- Give the NHS a legal duty to identify carers and develop a Carer’s
Passport scheme to inform carers of their rights in the NHS, like
more flexible visiting hours, assert their role as expert partners in
care and gain access to support.
- Improving social care
Although we want to support people to remain independent as long
as possible, many people will eventually need to rely on the care
system. Liberal Democrats fought hard to secure the cap on the cost
of care that will be introduced in 2017, but the quality of care is vital
too.
We have introduced rigorous new inspections under the Chief
Inspector of Social Care and new guidance to end the use of fifteen-minute visits. We will end ‘care cramming’, which turns care workers
into clockwatchers rushing between jobs. We are clamping down on
care workers being paid less than the National Minimum Wage by
resourcing and directing HMRC to pursue and prosecute providers
who exploit their staff.
We will:
- Finish the job of implementing the Dilnot Report proposals for a
cap on the cost of social care.
- Provide more choice at the end of life, and free end-of-life social
care for those placed on their local end-of-life register if evidence
shows it is affordable and cost effective.
- Ask the Care Quality Commission to showcase examples of good
and bad practice in care commissioning by Councils.
- Raise the professional status and training of care home managers
through statutory licensing.
- Ensure those who work in the care sector are properly trained and
suitable to practice by introducing a statutory code of conduct
backed up by a care workers’ suitability register.
- Work with local government and providers to promote paying a
Living Wage.


- Better places to live
Communities, farming and the natural environment
Liberal Democrats are the only major party that
takes seriously the responsibility of protecting
our natural environment. We believe it is vital to
make sure everyone has access to clean water,
clean air and green spaces. We want to hand
our countryside and green spaces on to the next
generation in a better condition than when we
were children.


Liberal Democrats are the only major party that takes seriously the
responsibility of protecting our natural environment. We believe it
is vital to make sure everyone has access to clean water, clean air
and green spaces. We want to hand our countryside and green
spaces on to the next generation in a better condition than when
we were children. That is why we have consistently defended the
natural environment in government, bringing forward plans for a
5p charge for plastic bags, planting a million extra trees in England
and ensuring Natural England remains a strong and independent
organisation able to speak up for nature. We have fought to protect
the Green Belt and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and we
have increased public access to our coastal paths.
Liberal Democrats are proud to represent a large part of rural
Britain and many farming constituencies. We believe a fair society
is one where people can afford to work and live in the countryside,
and where farmers get the support they need. We want them to
have a prosperous, sustainable future, and help them cope with
the challenges facing them, from floods to animal diseases. That is
why we introduced the Groceries Code Adjudicator to ensure large
supermarkets treat their suppliers lawfully and fairly. We have spent
£3.2 billion on flood management and defences over the course of
this Parliament. Liberal Democrats have kept farming and the natural
environment at the top of the agenda over the past five years. We
will ensure it remains a priority in the next Parliament.


A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More
- Expand accessible green space
with new National Nature Parks
chosen by local communities, and
plant a tree for every child born
- Drive up recycling to 70% of
household waste and minimise
landfill
- Save lives by cleaning up our air,
with low emission zones in towns
with a pollution problem
- Complete broadband rollout
to every home, and create an
innovation fund to help keep local
GPs, post offices and libraries open
- Planted a million trees and protected
our national forests by blocking plans
to sell them off
- Introduced a 5p charge on
throwaway plastic bags to
reduce waste
- £500m investment package to
promote Ultra Low Emission vehicles
which will cut emissions and improve
air quality
- Halted the Post Office closure
programme and brought broadband
to 80% of homes.

- Protecting nature
Britain’s natural environment is precious. Without our green spaces,
we would live less satisfying lives; they are critical to health,
wellbeing and our sense of community. Even in cash terms, short-term
profits from exploiting the environment carry a longer-term
penalty in squandered resources, clear-up costs and the impact on
health.
We will ensure that protecting the natural environment becomes a
core commitment of every government department and agency.
We will:
- Pass a Nature Act to put the Natural Capital Committee (NCC)
on a statutory footing, set natural capital targets, including
on biodiversity, clean air and water, and empower the NCC to
recommend actions to meet these targets.
- Significantly increase the amount of accessible green space.


We will complete the coastal path, introduce a fuller Right to
Roam and a new designation of National Nature Parks to protect
up to a million acres of accessible green space valued by local
communities.
- Place the management of public forests on a sustainable footing,
in line with the recommendations of the Independent Panel on
Forestry, and plant at least an additional tree for every child born
– about 750,000 every year – as part of a major afforestation plan.
- Tackle wildlife and environmental crime with increased
enforcement of environmental regulations by all relevant
authorities and higher penalties to ensure environmental crime is
not a financial risk worth taking.
- Improve UK enforcement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directive.
- Bring forward a package of measures to protect bees and other
pollinators, including legal protection for bumblebee nests.
- Designate an ecologically coherent network of marine protected
areas with appropriate management by 2020.
- Encourage the uptake of water metering, including introducing
metering in all defined water-stressed areas by 2025, coupled
with the development of national social tariffs to protect low-income
households.
Liberal Democrats believe in the highest standards of animal
welfare. We will review the rules surrounding the sale of pets to
ensure they promote responsible breeding and sales and minimise
the use of animals in scientific experimentation, including by funding
research into alternatives. We remain committed to the three Rs of
humane animal research: Replace, Reduce, Refine.
- Waste not, want not: using our resources to
generate lasting prosperity
The successful economies of the future will be ‘circular’ - where waste
and the use of non-renewable resources are minimised and recovery,
reuse and recycling are maximised. Britain has a real opportunity to
lead the way, generating sustainable prosperity and jobs.
We will bring forward a comprehensive waste strategy to build a thriving
reuse and recycling industry and pass a Resource Efficiency and Zero
Waste Act to:
- Task the Natural Capital Committee with producing a ‘Stern report’
on resource use, identifying resources being used unsustainably
and recommending legally binding targets for reducing their net
consumption.
- Use regulation both nationally and in the EU to promote sustainable


design where reparability, reuse and recyclability are prioritised, and
to reduce packaging waste.
- Establish a coherent tax and regulatory framework for landfill,
incineration and waste collection to drive continuous increases in
reuse and recycling rates and ensure only non-recyclable waste
is incinerated, including reinstating the Landfill Tax escalator and
extending it to the lower rate and consulting on the introduction of an
Incineration Tax.
- Commission the Natural Capital Committee to investigate the
potential for other resource taxes, including deposit refund schemes.
- Establish a statutory waste recycling target of 70% in England.
- Encourage the growth of anaerobic digestion to produce biogas
for heat and transport, and sustainable fertiliser, working with Local
Authorities to extend separate food waste collections to at least 90%
of homes by 2020.
- Food and farming
Our farmers do an essential job putting food on our tables and
enhancing the natural environment, but food policy has been
neglected for too long. We will encourage investment, growth,
innovation and new entrants, securing the future of the UK food and
farming industry.
Liberal Democrats want continued reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy, eliminating the remaining production and export
subsidies and supporting the development of environmentally
sustainable solutions to growing demand for food.
We will:
- Ensure farming support is concentrated on sustainable food
production, conservation and tackling climate change, shifting
CAP payments to the active farmer rather than the landowner.
- Introduce a National Food Strategy to promote the production
and consumption of healthy, sustainable and affordable food. Our
strategy will increase the use of locally and sustainably sourced,
healthy and seasonal food, including in public institutions like
schools and the NHS, implementing and expanding Defra’s Plan
for Public Procurement.
- Work at EU level to ensure clear and unambiguous country of
origin labelling on meat, meat products, milk and dairy products.
- Continue to support the Groceries Code Adjudicator. We will allow
the Adjudicator to use discretion when holding a supermarket
responsible for the treatment of suppliers so they can help ensure
farmers get a fair price. This will help all suppliers, including in the
dairy industry, which is under particular pressure.


- Ensure the Food Standards Agency is adequately resourced
to enforce food safety standards, and strengthen food fraud
surveillance.
- Help farmers and growers compete internationally by continuing
to reduce the administrative and regulatory burden and
developing an Animal Disease Strategy to reduce the risks and
costs of animal disease.
- Continue to improve standards of animal welfare, building on
Britain’s leadership. We will review the use of cages, crates and
routine preventive antibiotics.
- Introduce effective, science-led ways of controlling bovine TB,
including by investing to produce workable vaccines, in line with
the TB Eradication Strategy. We will only support extending the
existing cull pilots if they are shown to be effective, humane and
safe.
- Fully implement recent reforms of the Common Fisheries Policy,
working with industry and others to develop a national plan for
sustainable UK fisheries, with fair treatment for the inshore small
boat fleet.
- Adapting to climate change
The devastating floods experienced over the past few years are
a sign of accelerating climate change, exacerbated by changing
patterns of land use. We need to find better ways of adapting to
storms, gales, flooding and heat waves that put increased pressure
on infrastructure, water supplies and ecosystems.
We will:
- Prepare a national resilience plan to help the UK economy,
national infrastructure and natural resources adapt to the likely
impacts of a 3-4 degree global average temperature rise.
- Work with local government to review the governance of flood risk
and land drainage, including the role of Internal Drainage Boards,
and introduce high standards for flood resilience for buildings and
infrastructure in flood risk areas.
- Set up a commission to research back-to-nature flood prevention
schemes, including the role of habitats such as upland bogs
and moors, woodlands, wetlands and species-rich grasslands in
absorbing and holding water.
- Implement programmes to help farmers and other land users
adapt to climate change impacts including protecting soil
and forest carbon sinks, encouraging planting in uplands and
restoring flood plains.
- Review the system of approvals required by landowners to repair


Planting a new
tree for every


existing flood protection measures on their land.
- Increase the uptake of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems to
maximise value for money for the taxpayer. We will consult on the
best ways to finance this.
- Update construction and planning standards to futureproof
buildings against higher summer temperatures.
- Air quality and greener transport
Poor air quality is a significant health problem. After smoking,
estimates suggest it is Britain’s second biggest public health
challenge, responsible for the equivalent of 29,000 deaths every
year. We will pass a Green Transport Act, including a National Plan
to improve dramatically Britain’s air quality by 2020.
Our National Air Quality Plan for consultation will include:
- A legal requirement targeted at the most polluted towns and
cities, to create Low Emission Zones.
- New incentives for local schemes that cut transport-related
pollution, and encourage walking and cycling.
- A review of the MOT process, to see whether changes could be
introduced to cut emissions from existing vehicles.
- Support for new EU proposals on air quality targets and updated
plans to more quickly meet existing EU air quality standards for
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide.
To promote innovation and greener transport choices we will:
- Support ambitious EU vehicle emission standards, and reform
Vehicle Excise Duty to drive continuous reductions in greenhouse
gas and other pollutants from the UK car fleet and return
revenues to levels projected in 2010. This will include introducing
separate banding for new diesel cars.
- Encourage the market for electric vehicles, including with targeted
support for buses, taxis and light freight, and early requirements
to use low emission vehicles in the public sector. We will set a
target of 2040 for the date after which only Ultra-Low Emission
vehicles will be permitted on UK roads for non-freight purposes.
- Work with industry to accelerate the commercial introduction of
zero emission fuel cell electric vehicles, and facilitate the UK-wide
introduction of hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.
- Review the best way to keep our regulatory framework updated to
permit use of driverless and personal electric vehicles.
- Support options for an intercity cycleway along the HS2 route,
within the overall budget for the project.


- Implement the recommendations of the Get Britain Cycling report,
including steps to deliver a £10 a head annual public expenditure
on cycling within existing budgets. This will allow greater
investment in cycling including bike lanes, high-volume secure
bike parking, and road safety measures to keep cyclists safe.
- Improving local public transport
High-quality public transport is essential to building sustainable
communities and local economies, and two thirds of public transport
journeys are made by bus. With more people commuting to work by
bus than any other mode of public transport, buses are of significant
importance to the economy. Bus services are also particularly
important to many rural and isolated communities, where one in five
of the population lives.
- Carry out a review of bus funding and bus policies and introduce
a five-year investment plan to give the industry and Local
Authorities certainty and help plan investment. We will support
local areas that want to bring forward plans for regulating the bus
network in their area.
- Give new powers to Local Authorities and communities to
improve transport in their areas, including the ability to introduce
network-wide ticketing like in London.
- Support the expansion of smart ticketing systems.
- Continue funding for local economic and sustainable transport
infrastructure through the Local Growth Fund.
- Help bus companies trade in older, more polluting buses and
coaches for newer, low emissions ones, helping develop the
market for low-carbon buses.
- Sustainable rural communities
A thriving rural community needs local services and community
facilities like schools, public transport, local shops, cultural venues
and pubs. It needs enough homes, affordable for local families, to
ensure those services are viable. And it needs public transport:
travel costs are a major component of rural poverty. Liberal
Democrats understand the changes needed to support a living,
working countryside.
We will:
- Renew the 2010–15 commitment that there will be no programme
of Post Office closures and protect Royal Mail’s Universal Service
Obligation to deliver across the UK for the same price.


- Introduce ‘retained’ police officers, fully trained officers available
to respond when needed, to increase police presence in rural
communities.
- Develop the Community Budgets model for use in rural areas to
combine services, encouraging the breaking down of boundaries
between different services. This will help keep rural services like
GP surgeries, pharmacies, post offices and libraries open by
enabling them to cooperate, share costs and co-locate in shared
facilities.
- Continue the fuel discount scheme for remote areas implemented
by Liberal Democrat Ministers and work with the European
Commission to extend it to further remote areas with high fuel
costs.
- Work with Local Authorities to integrate transport networks in
rural areas, building on the work of Liberal Democrat Ministers’
Total Transport pilot.


Green Britain Guarantee:
Five Green Laws
A Nature Act which will include:
- Placing the Natural Capital Committee on a
statutory footing. The Committee was set up
in 2012; it provides advice to the government
on the state of England’s natural assets
including forests, rivers, land, minerals and
oceans.
- A requirement for government to set out
a 25-year plan for recovering nature, with
annual updates to Parliament, including how
to reverse the decline of UK species and
their habitats and ensure that bees and other
insects are able to fulfil their important role as
crop pollinators.
- The introduction of a new Public Sector
Sustainability Duty, requiring steadily higher
green criteria in public procurement policy,
and placing requirements on public authorities
to act in a sustainable manner.
- Implementation of the findings of the
Independent Panel on Forestry, creating a new
public body, free from political interference
and securely funded, to own and manage the
national forests.
- Transposition of EU air and water quality
targets into UK law to confirm our
commitments.
- A sustainable water abstraction regime, for the
public, industry and the natural environment.
- The formation of a one million square
kilometre southern Atlantic Ocean reserve.
A Resource Efficiency
and Zero Waste Britain
Act which will include:
- Implementation of
recommendations from
our planned ‘Stern
Report’ on resource
efficiency, which
the Natural Capital
Committee will conduct.
- Increased penalties
for waste crimes,
aiming to move from an
average fine of £50,000
to £75,000 and to an
average sentence of 12
to 18 months.
- A statutory recycling
target of 70% for waste
in England.
- Regulation to promote
design that enhances
repairability, reuse and
recycling, requiring
specified products to
be sold with parts and
labour guarantees for at
least five years.


Liberal Democrats will put the environment
at the heart of government policy. We
will pass five green laws to establish
a permanent legal framework for a
prosperous, sustainable economy.
A Green Buildings Act
which will include:
- A Council Tax
discount for significant
improvements in energy
efficiency in homes.
- Ambitious targets for
all social and private
rented homes to reach
Energy Performance
Certificate Band C by
2027.
- A statutory target to
bring the homes of all
fuel-poor households to
Band C by 2027.
- A new legal framework
to require regulators
to facilitate the
development of deep
geothermal heat, large-scale
heat pumps,
waste industrial heat
and energy storage
systems.
- New powers for
government to
introduce new energy
efficiency and heat
saving regulations to
reduce heat and energy
use.
A Zero Carbon Britain
Act which will include:
- A new legally-binding
target for Zero Carbon
Britain by 2050, to be
monitored and audited
by the Climate Change
Committee (CCC).
The Climate Change
Act 2008 established
an aim to reduce
UK greenhouse gas
emissions by 80% by
2050 based on the 1990
baseline.
- A 2030 power sector
decarbonisation target
of 50-100g per kWh, as
recommended by the
CCC.
- Emission Performance
Standards for existing
coal power stations,
designed to ensure
electricity generation
from unabated coal will
stop by 2025.
- Giving full borrowing
powers to the Green
Investment Bank,
to boost further
investment in low-carbon
technologies.
A Green Transport Act
which will include:
- A statutory target of
2030 by which time all
major, regularly used
rail routes will need to
be electrified.
- A requirement that
every new bus and taxi
is Ultra Low Emission
from 2030 and every car
on the road meets that
standard by 2040.
- The creation of Low
Emission Zones as part
of a national air quality
plan, including a legal
requirement for the
most polluted towns
and cities.
- A new statutory
framework that all new
rail franchises include
a stronger focus on
customers.
- Updates to roads
regulation to promote
innovation in transport
like driverless cars
and personal electric
vehicles.


- Affordable homes for all
Meeting our housing needs
For people to live fulfilled lives they need a
decent home at a cost they can afford. But that
simple ambition is getting further and further out
of reach. Britain has failed for decades to build
enough homes, and in many places property
prices and rents have risen beyond what normal
working families can afford. We have to speed up
house building and stop prices from getting any
further out of reach of families.


For people to live fulfilled lives they need a decent home at a cost
they can afford. But that simple ambition is getting further and
further out of reach. Britain has failed for decades to build enough
homes, and in many places property prices and rents have risen
beyond what normal working families can afford. Meanwhile
many older people in homes that are no longer right for their
circumstances would like to move but do not have suitable options.
We have made a start in addressing this. The supply of affordable
rented housing has been increasing. We have liberalised the
planning system, while protecting important green spaces. We have
pushed government departments to release unwanted sites for
homes.
But the problems are now in danger of becoming a crisis, with
home ownership plummeting among the under 40s, many young
people priced out of even renting a place of their own, and the risk of
a new housing bubble, focused on London and the South East. We
have to speed up house building and stop prices from getting any
further out of reach of families.


- Set an ambitious goal to build
300,000 homes a year, including
in 10 new Garden Cities in areas
where homes are needed most
- New Rent to Own homes where
your monthly payments steadily
buy you a stake in the property
- New Help to Rent tenancy deposit
loans to help young people get into
their first place
- Cut Council Tax by £100 for 10
years if you insulate your home,
and ban landlords from letting out
homes tenants cannot reasonably
afford to heat
- Restored house building from record
lows to nearly 150,000 a year
- Helped families buy a home with Help
to Buy equity loans
- Banned ‘revenge evictions’ where
rogue landlords evict tenants who
make complaints
- Improved the energy efficiency of
a million homes since 2013, cutting
overall UK energy use by 2.5% a year
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Building more and better homes
For far too long Britain has built many fewer homes than we need;
unless we build enough to meet demand, year after year, we will find
housing costs rise further out of reach. That is why we have set an
ambitious target of increasing the rate of house building to 300,000
a year. Within the first year of the next Parliament, we will publish a
long-term plan that sets out how this goal will be achieved.
Our plans will include:
- At least ten new Garden Cities in England, in areas where there
is local support, providing tens of thousands of high-quality new
homes, with gardens and shared green space, jobs, schools and
public transport. We will encourage rural Local Authorities to
follow these principles on a smaller scale, too, developing new
garden villages or suburbs as part of their plans for growth.


- Up to five major new settlements along a Garden Cities Railway
between Oxford and Cambridge.
- Ambitious targets for development on unwanted public sector
sites through the Homes and Communities Agency, with Local
Authorities given new powers to ensure development happens on
any unused site in which the public sector has an interest.
- A review of Compulsory Purchase legislation to facilitate
site assembly, including for Garden Cities. We will also pilot
techniques for capturing the increase in land values from the
granting of planning permission, helping to deliver our Garden
Cities.
- A government commissioning programme to boost house building
towards our 300,000 target; where the market alone fails to deliver
sufficient numbers, government agencies will directly commission
homes for sale and rent to fill the gap. We are already piloting this
direct approach in Cambridgeshire.
- A new government-backed Housing Investment Bank to provide
long-term capital for major new settlements and help attract
finance for major house building projects.
- Improving planning
Good planning is essential to delivering sustainable communities.
With effective planning rules, we can ensure the new homes we
build are well connected to public transport, resilient to the threats
of climate change, safe, warm and secure, and situated in real
communities where people can easily come together. We will work
with Local Authorities to ensure they think for the long term, and use
their powers to facilitate an affordable local housing market.
We will:
- Put Local Authorities in the driving seat for plan-led development
by requiring them to make a plan for 15 years of housing need,
working collaboratively with neighbouring Councils where
necessary to identify sites. We will strengthen the Duty to
Cooperate to help authorities – like Cambridge, Oxford and Luton
– with insufficient space within the Local Authority boundary to
meet housing demand to grow, through development on sites
beyond the Local Authority boundaries. This long-term approach
will enable us to secure the homes we need while being much
stricter about proposals that deviate from the Local Plan. We will:
- Create a Community Right of Appeal in cases where
planning decisions go against the approved local plan, or a
Local Plan that is emerging and has undergone substantive
consultation.


- Not allow developers’ appeals against planning decisions
that are in line with the local plan.
- Not allow planning appeals solely on the basis of
challenges to the 15-year master plan.
- Improve housing needs assessments to ensure they respond
to demand, including through price signals, rather than simply
need, and segment more effectively demand from different kinds
of household, including high-quality shared accommodation for
young people. All areas will be expected to plan for the needs
of older people for age-appropriate housing and we will work
with Local Authorities to help people who wish to ‘right size’,
particularly in later life.
- Require Local Authorities to keep a register of people who want a
self-build plot in the local area and plan to meet demand for these
plots, including through ‘affordable land’: plots on which self-builders
can take a long-term lease at an affordable rent and build
or commission a home.
- Update planning law to introduce the concept of ‘landscape
scale planning’ and ensure new developments promote walking,
cycling, car sharing and public transport and improve rather than
diminish access to green spaces.
- Prioritise development on brownfield and town centre sites and
bring to an end the permitted development rights for converting
offices to residential.
- Enable Local Authorities to:
- Attach planning conditions to new developments to ensure
homes are occupied, tackling the growth of ‘buy to leave
empty’ investments from overseas in property hotspots like
London.
- Levy up to 200% Council Tax on second homes where they
judge this to be appropriate.
- Pilot new planning conditions to ensure local communities
benefit from increased housing supply.
- Affordable housing
The government has an essential role to play in supporting
the development of affordable housing. We have maintained a
substantial programme of affordable house building in the last five
years, in part enabled by designing innovative products that can
deliver new homes at a lower cost. We will continue to innovate,
enabling Local Authorities, Housing Associations and central
government alike to build many more homes.


We will:
- Review the Homes and Communities Agency’s grant programmes
to simplify and streamline the process and enable more innovation.
- Allow Local Authorities more flexibility to borrow to build
affordable housing, including traditional council housing, and
devolve full control of the Right to Buy.
- Scrap plans to exempt smaller housing development schemes
from their obligation to provide affordable homes.
- Encourage affordable housing providers – both Councils
and Housing Associations – to innovate, including using the
development of homes for sale or market rent to help subsidise
new affordable homes. We will refocus the Vacant Building Credit
so it only applies to properties that have been vacant for an
extended period.
- Tackle overcrowding with a new system to incentivise social
landlords to reduce the number of tenants under-occupying their
homes, freeing up larger properties.
- Introduce a new Intermediate Housing Fund to fund intermediate
housing products, including:
- Affordable Rent homes, at up to 80% of local market rent.
- Shared Ownership homes, where customers buy a
proportion of the home and pay an affordable rent for the
rest.
- A new Rent to Own model where monthly payments
steadily accrue the tenant a percentage stake in the
property, owning it outright after 30 years.
- New build shared accommodation at the local LHA Shared
Accommodation Rate.
We recognise that most people aspire to own their own home, and
believe in supporting people on the journey to home ownership. But
policies that promote home ownership should be focused on newly
built homes to prevent artificial pressure on prices, and should not
discriminate on the basis of previous housing tenure.
- Protecting private tenants and leaseholders
More and more people – including families – are renting in the
private sector for the long term. We believe private renting is an
important part of the housing market, but the balance has shifted
too far against the tenant, and more needs to be done to help
people making a home in rented property.


We will:
- Improve protections against rogue landlords and encourage a
new multi-year tenancy with an agreed inflation-linked annual rent
increase built in.
- Enable Local Authorities to operate licensing schemes for rental
properties in areas where they believe it is needed.
- Establish a voluntary register of rented property where either
the landlord or the tenant can register the property, to improve
enforcement and tax transparency.
- Ban letting agent fees to tenants if the transparency requirements
we introduced are not successful in bringing fees down to an
affordable level by the end of 2016.
- Extend the use of Rent Repayment Orders to allow tenants to
have their rent refunded when a property is found to contain
serious risks to health, and withhold rent from landlords who have
not carried out court-ordered improvements within a reasonable
period of time.
- Introduce a new Help to Rent scheme to provide government-backed
tenancy deposit loans for all first-time renters under 30.
- Conduct a full review of the help single people get under
homelessness legislation.
- Affordable warmth and greener homes
Warming our homes is an essential part of the fight against climate
change, and also vital to keep bills affordable. Energy prices
in Britain are lower than the EU average but our bills are higher
because our homes are so poorly insulated. We have made huge
advances in this Parliament, increasing standards for newly built
homes, and improving more than a million homes in just two years.
In the next Parliament we will go further, ensuring at least four million
homes are improved by 2020, not only lowering bills and helping to
tackle the scourge of fuel poverty, but generating jobs too.
We will:
- Remove exemptions in the Zero Carbon Standard for new homes,
increasing the standard steadily and extending it to non-domestic
buildings from 2019. We will promote the development of off-site
manufacturing techniques, which have been shown to improve
energy performance of buildings.
- Pass a new Green Buildings Act to set new energy efficiency
targets, including a long-term ambition for every home to reach at
least an energy rating of Band C by 2035.


- Act to tackle fuel poverty, ensuring all low-income homes are
brought up to Band C by 2027, with continued support for the
Green Deal Communities programme, enabling local Councils to
provide help street by street.
- Improve the standard of private rented and social housing,
requiring these homes to be upgraded to Band C by 2027.
- Introduce incentives to help everyone invest in energy efficiency:
- A Council Tax reduction of at least £100 for 10 years, when
the resident’s home has an energy saving improvement of
at least two bands.
- A new Feed Out Tariff for investment in solid wall insulation,
the most expensive and difficult energy saving investment
for some homes.
- Reform the Green Deal ‘pay as you save’ scheme into a new
Green Homes Loan Scheme, funding renewable heat and
electricity alongside energy efficiency.
- Boost community energy efficiency by empowering the Green
Investment Bank to develop innovative financial products for
whole street or district-wide energy efficiency retrofits.
- Develop a range of targeted, innovative programmes to support
the above, including infrastructure funding where appropriate,
such as:
- ‘Insulation on prescription’ to link up the NHS with the fuel
poverty agenda.
- An Off-Gas-Grid Strategy to help rural areas benefit from
new technologies.
- Interest-free loans to fund energy efficiency home
improvements.


- Freedom and opportunity
Equal rights for all
Liberal Democrats have always been champions
of liberty and human rights. Freedom of
expression has recently been under renewed
attack, and siren voices call for us to sacrifice
freedom to gain illusory security. Liberal
Democrats reject this false choice: true security
for individuals and for our nation must be built
on a platform of equal rights and civil liberties.
Discrimination and inequality can hold people
back just as much as a lack of legal freedoms.
Opportunities are not equally distributed in
modern Britain. That must change, and will with
Liberal Democrats in government.


Liberal Democrats have always been champions of liberty and
human rights. No one can make the most of their lives if their basic
freedoms are violated. This election comes just a month before we
celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, a foundation stone
of our liberties. Legal protections have come a long way since then,
but as society and technology becomes more complex there is a
never-ending struggle to reassert the principle of individual liberty.
Freedom of expression has recently been under renewed attack,
and siren voices call for us to sacrifice freedom to gain illusory
security. Liberal Democrats reject this false choice: true security for
individuals and for our nation must be built on a platform of equal
rights and civil liberties.
Discrimination and inequality can hold people back just as much
as a lack of legal freedoms. Opportunities are not equally distributed
in modern Britain. Where you are from, what your parents did, your
ethnicity, health, sexuality and gender still too often affect your
chances in life, your educational attainments, your work prospects,
how you are treated by the police and the justice system, and
even how long you will live. That must change, and will with Liberal
Democrats in government.


- Protect your privacy by updating
data laws for the internet age with
a Digital Bill of Rights
- A second Freedoms Act to protect
free speech, stop heavy-handed
policing and ban Mosquito devices
that discriminate against young
people.
- Combat homophobic bullying and
discrimination, including in schools
- Support a million more women who
want to work with better childcare,
help with caring responsibilities and
action against discrimination
- Fight discrimination in the criminal
justice system and recruit more
Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic
police officers
- Scrapped ID cards and blocked the
so-called Snooper’s Charter that
would have monitored everyone’s
internet use
- Freedoms Act to cut intrusive CCTV,
stop fingerprinting children in schools
and stop aggressive wheel clamping
- Introduced equal marriage for gay
and lesbian couples
- Reduced the gender pay gap and
increased the number of women on
boards
- Stopped locking up children of
asylum seekers and strengthened
rules on police stop and search
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Equality and diversity
A fair society should treat its citizens equally and with dignity. In this
Parliament, thanks to Liberal Democrats in government, there have
been key advances in the fight for equality – like introducing same-sex
marriage and banning age discrimination. But we must continue
our work to fight prejudice and discrimination based on race, age,
religion or belief, gender, sexuality, and disability. We will enact the
remaining unimplemented clauses of the Equality Act 2010.

To advance the cause of women and gender equality we will:
- Set an ambitious goal to see a million more women in work by
2020 thanks to more jobs, better childcare, and better back-to-work
support.
- Challenge gender stereotyping and early sexualisation, working
with schools to promote positive body image and widespread
understanding of sexual consent law, and break down outdated
perceptions of gender appropriateness of particular academic
subjects.
- Work to end the gender pay gap, including with new rules on
gender pay transparency.
- Continue the drive for diversity in business leadership,
maintaining momentum towards at least 30% of board members
being women and encouraging gender diversity among senior
managers, too. We will work to achieve gender equity in
government programmes that support entrepreneurs.
To promote equality in relationships and for LGBT+ individuals, we will:
- Give legal rights and obligations to cohabiting couples in the
event of relationship breakdown or one partner dying without a
will.
- Permit humanist weddings and opposite sex civil partnerships,
and liberalise the rules about the location, timing and content of
wedding ceremonies.
- Support schools to tackle homophobic and transphobic
bullying and discrimination, and to establish a tolerant and
inclusive environment for all their pupils. We will remove schools’
exemption from the bar on harassment in these areas while
protecting the right to teach about religious doctrine.
- Promote international recognition of same sex marriages and
civil partnerships as part of a comprehensive International LGBT
Rights Strategy that supports the cause of decriminalising
homosexuality in other countries.
- Seek to pardon all those with historic convictions for consensual
homosexual activity between adults.
- Enhance the experience of all football fans by making
homophobic chanting a criminal offence, like racist chanting.
- Ask the Advisory Committee on Safety of Blood, Tissues and
Organs periodically to review rules around men who have sex
with men donating blood to consider what restrictions remain
necessary.
To tackle the racial discrimination faced by Black, Asian and Minority
Ethnic (BAME) people we will:


- Build on the Coalition’s BAME Access to Finance report to identify
ways to encourage more BAME applicants to apply for finance
and set up small business. We will publish diversity data on
government entrepreneurship programmes and seek to achieve
fair representation of BAME communities.
- Encourage businesses to ensure at least one place on their board
is filled by a BAME candidate.
- Monitor and tackle the BAME pay gap.
- Outlaw caste discrimination.
- Maintain funding for people to develop and improve their English
language skills to enable them to fully participate in society and
achieve their potential.
- Challenge discrimination in the criminal justice system by:
- Improving the safeguards in police stop and search powers
in England and Wales with tighter guidance and requiring
police to wear body cameras in Section 60 areas, the
establishment of which will require judicial sanction.
- Boosting police recruitment from BAME groups.
- Conducting a full review of the causes of the
overrepresentation of BAME individuals in the criminal
justice system.
To tackle religious discrimination and support faith and belief
communities in working together we will:
- Continue support for the Interfaith Network to promote strong and
sustainable relations between different faith communities.
- Support projects aimed at tackling intolerance such as Show
Racism the Red Card and the Anne Frank Trust UK.
- Work closely with faith and community organisations, such as
the Community Security Trust (which works to protect the Jewish
community against antisemitic attacks) and the Muslim Council
of Britain, to prevent hate crime, including at places of worship
like synagogues and mosques. We are determined to combat
antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate in the UK and internationally.
To empower people with disabilities to live full lives and achieve their
potential we will:
- Improve the benefits system for disabled people, based on the
principle of one assessment, one budget. This will bring together
support like Personal Independence Payment, Employment
Support Allowance, a replacement for the Independent Living
Fund and health and social care entitlements. We will implement
the proposals set out in the 2015 Green Paper on Learning
Disabilities.


- Ensure disabled people who need an extra room are entitled to
one in any assessment of their Housing Benefit needs.
- Help greater numbers of disabled people work by encouraging
employers to shortlist any qualified disabled candidate and
providing advice about workplace adaptation.
- Maintain Disabled Students’ Allowance to ensure students with
disabilities receive appropriate support in their university studies,
and review the impact of any changes to consider additional
protections for the most vulnerable students with disabilities.
- Make it easier to get around by:
- Making more stations wheelchair accessible and giving
wheelchair users priority over children’s buggies when
space is limited.
- Bringing into effect the provisions of the 2010 Equality Act
on discrimination by private hire vehicles and taxis.
- Improving the legislative framework governing Blue
Badges.
- Building on our successes in improving wheelchair access
to improve accessibility of public transport for people with
other disabilities, including visual and auditory impairment.
- Setting up a benchmarking standard for accessible cities.
- Tackle disability hate crime by ensuring proper monitoring of
incidents by police forces and other public authorities.
- Formally recognise British Sign Language as an official language
of the United Kingdom.
To ensure the highest standards of equality and fairness in public
services we will:
- Maintain the Public Sector Equality Duty and encourage external
providers to the public sector to follow best practice in terms of
diversity.
- Prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion in the provision
of public services.
- Move to ‘name blank’ recruitment wherever possible in the public
sector.
- Replicate the civil service accelerated programme for
underrepresented groups across the public sector.
- Require diversity in Public Appointments. We will introduce
a presumption that every shortlist should include a BAME
candidate. We will establish an independent committee that will
monitor the drive for greater diversity in public appointments and
verify the independence of the appointment process to public
bodies, boards and institutions.
- Work to ensure the shift to Digital by Default for public services
does not leave people behind, by upholding the highest standards


of accessibility in digital services and maintaining government
programmes on digital inclusion.
- Freedom of speech and the free press
As the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris showed, freedom of
expression cannot be taken for granted. In an open society there
can be no right ‘not to be offended’, which is why Liberal Democrats
in government have strengthened the law to make it harder for
prosecutions to be brought for using 'insulting words', and have
led the way in protecting journalists’ sources under the 2000
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). Yet censorship and
self-censorship are still rife, and the threat of prosecution can have
a chilling effect on the willingness of people to speak out against
injustice and corruption. To change this and promote investigative
journalism, we will:
- Introduce statutory public interest defences for exceptional cases
where journalists may need to break the law (such as RIPA, the
2010 Bribery Act, and the 1998 Computer Misuse Act) to expose
corruption or other criminal acts.
- Ensure judicial authorisation is required for the acquisition of
communications data which might reveal journalists’ sources or
other privileged communications, for any of the purposes allowed
under RIPA; and allow journalists the opportunity to address
the court before authorisation is granted, where this would not
jeopardise the investigation.
- Undertake a post-legislative review of the 2013 Defamation Act,
which Liberal Democrats drove through Parliament, to ensure the
new provisions are reducing the chill of libel threats.
- Introduce, after consultation on the detail, the changes to
the 1998 Data Protection Act recommended by Lord Justice
Leveson to provide a fairer balance between personal privacy
and the requirements of journalism, ensuring that the position of
investigative journalists is safeguarded.
To promote the independence of the media from political influence
we will remove Ministers from any role in appointments to the BBC
Trust or the Board of Ofcom.
To guarantee press freedom, we will pass a British ‘First
Amendment’ law, to require the authorities and the courts to have
regard to the importance of a free media in a democratic society.
To nurture public interest journalism and protect the public from
press abuse, we are committed to a system of accountability that is
totally independent of both government and the newspaper industry,
as set out in the Royal Charter on Press Regulation.


We share the hope of Lord Justice Leveson that the incentives
for the press to sign up to genuinely independent self-regulation
will succeed. But if, in the judgment of the Press Recognition Panel,
after 12 months of operation, there is significant non-cooperation
by newspaper publishers, then – as Leveson himself concluded –
Parliament will need to act, drawing on a range of options including
the legislative steps necessary to ensure that independent self-regulation
is delivered. Where possible, we would seek to do this
on the same cross-party basis that achieved the construction of the
Leveson scheme by the Royal Charter.
- Policing and security service powers
Liberal Democrats believe security and liberty are two sides of the
same coin: you cannot have one without the other. The police and
intelligence agencies do vital work to protect the public and we
are rightly proud of them. But we always have to be vigilant that
the state does not overreach itself, as it has done at times through
corruption, heavy-handedness or illiberal laws.
We will:
- Ensure proper oversight of the security services.
- Establish in legislation that the police and intelligence agencies
should not obtain data on UK residents from foreign governments
that it would not be legal to obtain in the UK under UK law.
- Back a full judicial enquiry into complicity in torture if the
current investigation by the Commons Intelligence and Security
Committee investigation fails to get to truth.
- End indefinite detention for immigration purposes.
- Introduce restrictions on the indefinite use of police bail.
- Require judicial authorisation for the use of undercover police
officers to infiltrate alleged criminal groups.
- Get to the full truth about corrupt practices in parts of the police
and the press by ensuring that the Daniel Morgan Panel Inquiry
is completed expeditiously and that Part 2 of the Leveson Inquiry
starts as soon as the criminal prosecutions in the hacking scandal
are completed.
- Identify practical alternatives to the use of closed material
procedures within the justice system, including the provisions of
the 2013 Justice and Security Act, with the aim of restoring the
principle of open justice.


- Securing liberty online
In the modern digital age, the power of the state and of corporate
interests can threaten our privacy and liberty. We have achieved
much in rolling back the over-mighty state – passing the first ever
Protection of Freedoms Act to restore lost civil liberties, securing
the ongoing root and branch review of RIPA and legislating for the
creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board – but we cannot
be complacent. There will be a complete overhaul of surveillance
powers in 2016. We need to ensure this and other opportunities are
seized as a chance to control excessive state power, and ensure
that in an era when surveillance is easier than ever before, we
maintain the right to privacy and free speech. Privacy should always
be the norm for personal data, meaning surveillance must always
be justified and proportionate and any demand to read private
encrypted communications must be targeted and proportionate.
We will:
- Pass a Digital Bill of Rights, to define and enshrine the digital
rights of the citizen.
- Safeguard the essential freedom of the internet and back net
neutrality, the principle that internet service providers should
enable access to all lawful content and applications regardless of
the source, and without favouring or blocking particular products
or websites.
- Oppose the introduction of the so-called Snooper’s Charter.
We blocked the draft Communications Data Bill and would
do so again. Requiring companies to store a record of
everyone’s internet activities for a year or to collect third-party
communications data for non-business purposes is
disproportionate and unacceptable, as is the blanket surveillance
of our paper post.
- Set stricter limits on surveillance and consider carefully the
outcomes of the reviews we initiated on surveillance legislation by
the Royal United Services Institute and the Independent Reviewer
of Terrorism Legislation David Anderson QC. We are opposed to
the blanket collection of UK residents’ personal communications
by the police or the intelligence agencies. Access to metadata,
live content, or the stored content of personal communications
must only take place without consent where there is reasonable
suspicion of criminal activity or to prevent threats to life.


Our Freedoms
Act will:
- Tighten the regulation of CCTV, with more powers for the
Surveillance Camera Commissioner.
- Extend the rules governing storage of DNA and fingerprints
by public authorities to include all biometric data – like facial
images.
- Protect free speech by ensuring insulting words, jokes, and
non-intentional acts, are not treated as criminal, and that
social media communications are not treated more harshly
than other media.
- Prevent heavy-handed policing of demonstrations by tightly
regulating the use of ‘kettling’.
- Reform joint enterprise laws.
- Ban high-frequency Mosquito devices which discriminate
against young people.
- Strengthen safeguards to prevent pre-emptive arrests and
misuse of pre-charge bail conditions to restrict civil liberties
and stifle peaceful protest.
- End the Ministerial veto on release of information under the
Freedom of Information Act.
- Cut back on the petty over-regulation of everyday life, like
removing licensing requirements for leafleting for community
events, liberalising the restrictions on songs and readings
at wedding ceremonies, and permitting swimming in open
bodies of water.

- Securing our rights and freedoms in law
800 years after Magna Carta, the need for written, legal guarantees
of our rights and liberties has not gone away. We will:
- Protect the Human Rights Act and enshrine the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child in UK law. We will take appropriate action
to comply with decisions of UK courts and the European Court of
Human Rights.
- Block any further attempts to limit the right to trial by jury.
- Pass a new Freedoms Act, to protect citizens from excessive
state powers.


Our Digital Bill of
Rights will:
- Enshrine the principle that everyone has the right to control
their own personal data, and that everyone should be able
to view, correct, and (where appropriate and proportionate)
delete their personal data, wherever it is held.
- Forbid any public body from collecting, storing or
processing personal data without statutory authority, and
require any such legislation to be regularly reviewed.
- Give increased powers and resources for the Information
Commissioner and introduce custodial sentences for
egregious breaches of the Data Protection Act.
- Ensure privacy is protected to the same extent in telecoms
and online as in the offline world. Public authorities should
only invade an individual’s privacy where there is reasonable
suspicion of criminal activity or where it is otherwise
necessary and proportionate to do so in the public interest,
and with appropriate oversight by the courts.
- Ensure that privacy policies and terms and conditions of
online services, including smartphone apps, must be clear,
concise and easy for the user to understand.
- Uphold the right of individuals, businesses and public
bodies to use strong encryption to protect their privacy and
security online.
- Make it clear that online services have a duty to provide
age-appropriate policies, guidance and support to the
children and young people who use their services.


- Secure communities
Policing, justice and the border force
With Liberal Democrats in government, crime is
down 10%. That means fewer homes burgled,
fewer communities blighted and fewer people
hurt. But there is much more to do to reduce
crime and free people from fear.
The best way to protect the public is to stop
crime from happening in the first place, whether
by designing out crime, intervening early, or with
effective punishments that challenge offenders
and address their criminal behaviour. We will
make sure the number one priority for the
criminal justice system is to prevent crime by
cutting reoffending.


No one can fulfil their potential if they live in fear. By ensuring our
laws are upheld, we can build strong communities with opportunity
for all.

We have begun to tackle abuse in our immigration system, too,
closing colleges that break the rules, cracking down on illegal
working and human trafficking, and reintroducing border checks.
We will build on this record to rebuild confidence in our borders and
immigration system.


- Focus policing on crime prevention,
saving money by scrapping Police
and Crime Commissioners
- Cut crime with specialist
drug courts and non-criminal
punishments that help addicts get
clean
- Reform prisons to focus on turning
offenders away from a life of crime
- End FGM at home and abroad in a
generation, teach sexual consent
in our schools, and crack down on
domestic violence
- Complete border checks and use
the information to improve our visa
rules and deport people with no
right to stay
- Cut crime by 10%, with evidence-based
policing directed at the front
line
- Improved treatment for addiction and
mental health problems in prison
- More prisoners working longer hours
with wages contributing to a Victims’
Fund
- National strategy on fighting violence
against women and girls and ending
the awful practice of Female Genital
Mutilation
- Reintroduced border checks so we

A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Preventing crime
Crime and fear of crime are amongst the greatest threats to our
security and our ability to live our lives to the full. Our focus is on
trying to prevent crime from happening in the first place.
We will:
- Design out opportunities for crime, by improving the built
environment, the design of new technologies, and community
resilience.
- Strengthen the What Works centre within the College of Policing
and require HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to scrutinise the use



of evidence by local forces in designing their policing plans.
- Build on the success of crime maps to use data more effectively
to reduce crime, working towards the publication of business-by-business
data for crimes committed on commercial premises,
and exploring the feasibility of mandatory reporting of fraud
losses by individual credit and debit card providers.
- Improving local policing
We are successfully bringing down crime and improving the
efficiency of our police forces, but there is more to do. We believe
the police could be far more effective with proper support and
shared best practice.
We will:
- Guarantee the police pursue the public’s priorities by replacing
Police and Crime Commissioners with Police Boards made up of
Councillors from across the force area.
- Encourage police forces and other emergency services to work
together at a local, regional and national level to reduce back
office costs and deliver efficiency savings.
- Support and expand Police Now, which is bringing high-flying
graduates and skilled mid-career professionals into our police
forces.
- Explore the case for transferring responsibility for more serious
national crime to the National Crime Agency, enabling local police
forces to focus on local crime and anti-social behaviour.
- Step up our work with EU partners to tackle serious and
organised crime.
- Improve support for victims of crime
The criminal justice system exists to protect the public from crime;
where crime does occur victims are our first priority. We need
to make sure they, and their families, are supported both in the
aftermath of crimes and throughout the justice system.
We will:
- Enact a Victims’ Bill of Rights.
- Create a single point of contact for victims to give early access to
information and support.
- Change sentencing guidelines to increase sentences available for
hate crimes.


- Give victims of crime a right to review what progress police have
made to investigate the crime committed against them including
cases where the police have declined to investigate.
- Give victims a right to choose restorative justice.
- Implement the Modern Slavery Strategy to reduce people
trafficking and support victims.
9.4 Tackling violence against women and girls
A fair society cannot tolerate today’s unacceptable level of violence
against women and girls in Britain. We have made progress since
2010 but we will not rest until women feel safe and respected.
We will:
- Ensure teachers, social workers, police officers and health
workers in areas where there is high prevalence of female genital
mutilation or forced marriage are trained to help those at risk.
- Require the teaching of sexual consent in schools as part of age-appropriate
sex and relationships education.
- Improve the provision of rape crisis centres and refuges for
victims of domestic violence with a national network and national
sources of funding.
- Protect funding for tackling violence against women and girls and
maintain the post of International Champion for preventing this
violence.
- Create a national helpline for victims of domestic and sexual
violence – regardless of gender – to provide support, encourage
reporting and secure more convictions.
- Work to ensure the whole criminal justice system updates
practice in line with the Director of Public Prosecutions’ guidance
on sexual consent.
- Improving justice and rehabilitating offenders
The criminal justice system can do more to turn people away from
a life of crime. We have made progress in government, for the first
time providing probation support for offenders serving sentences
of less than twelve months. Yet still, far too many people are simply
warehoused in prison, instead of learning skills that will enable them
to earn an honest living when they are released.
We believe that a large prison population is a sign of failure to
rehabilitate, not a sign of success. So our aim is to significantly
reduce the prison population by using more effective alternative
punishments and correcting offending behaviour.




We will:
- Prioritise prison for dangerous offenders and those who commit
the most serious offences with increased use of tough noncustodial
punishments including weekend or evening custody,
curfews, unpaid work in the community and GPS tagging. This
will enable us to introduce a presumption against short-term
sentences that will help reduce the prison population and cut
crime.
- Promote Community Justice Panels and other local schemes
designed to stop problems from escalating.
- Extend the role of the Youth Justice Board to all offenders aged
under 21, give them the power to commission mental health
services and devolve youth custody budgets to Local Authorities.
- Create a Women’s Justice Board, modelled on the Youth Justice
Board, to improve rehabilitation of female offenders.
- Reform prisons so they become places of work, rehabilitation
and learning, with offenders receiving an education and skills
assessment within one week, starting a relevant course and
programme of support within one month and able to complete
courses on release.
- Improve prison governance and accountability with a new value
added measure to assess progress in reducing reoffending,
providing education and tackling addiction and mental health
issues, enabling good prisons to earn greater autonomy. We will
strengthen the independence of the Chief Inspectors of Prisons
and Probation.
- Provide experts in courts and police stations to identify where
mental health or a drug problem is behind an offender’s behaviour
so they can be dealt with in a way that is appropriate. We will pilot
US-style drug and alcohol courts.
- Strengthen the ‘realistic prospect of custody’ test to reduce
the use of remand for suspected offenders who can be safely
monitored in the community and are unlikely to receive a prison
sentence if found guilty.
Liberal Democrats will adopt the default position that – unless there
are strong reasons to the contrary in specific cases – public servants
rather than commercial organisations should provide detention,
prison, immigration enforcement and secure units.


- Ensuring access to justice
Access to justice is an essential part of a free society and a
functioning legal system. In this Parliament we have had to make
significant savings from the Legal Aid budget, but in the next
Parliament our priority for delivering efficiency in the Ministry of
Justice should be prison and court reform, using technology and
innovation to reduce costs.
We will:
- Review the criminal Legal Aid market and ensure there are no
further savings without an impact assessment as to the viability of
a competitive and diverse market of Legal Aid providers.
- Reduce pressure on the criminal Legal Aid budget by requiring
company directors to take out insurance against prosecution
for fraud and permitting the use of restrained assets to pay
reasonable legal bills.
- Carry out an immediate review of civil Legal Aid, judicial review
and court fees, in consultation with the judiciary, to ensure Legal
Aid is available to all those who need it, that those of modest
means can bring applications for judicial review of allegedly
unlawful government action and that court and tribunal fees will
not put justice beyond the reach of those who seek it. This will
mean reversing any recent rises in up-front court fees that make
justice unaffordable for many, and instead spreading the fee
burden more fairly.
- Retain access to recoverable success fees and insurance
premiums in asbestosis claims and where an individual is
suing the police; and also for both claimant and defendant in
publication and data protection claims, except where one party is
significantly better resourced than the other.
- Promote the use of alternative buildings for magistrates’ courts
and local dispute resolution programmes like Community Justice
Panels to bring justice back into the community.
- Support innovation like the provision of civil justice online and
expansion of alternative dispute resolution procedures.
- Encourage the widespread use of mediation for separating
couples, while protecting access to the family courts where
necessary
- Develop a strategy that will deliver advice and legal support to
help people with everyday problems like personal debt and social
welfare issues, working across government and involving non-profit
advice agencies.


- Tackling terrorism and violent extremism
Terrorism and violent extremism remain a serious threat to the
United Kingdom, which requires a proportionate response.
We will:
- Work with religious and community leaders, civil society groups
and social media sites to counter the narratives put forward by
extremists, and create the space for the expression of contrary
viewpoints and religious interpretations.
- Maintain laws that provide an effective defence against terrorist
activity, including proscription of terrorist groups, Terrorism
Prevention and Investigation Measures, and Temporary Exclusion
Orders, which enable the security services to manage the return
of those who have fought illegally in foreign conflicts.
- Ensure we continue to provide the appropriate resources to the
police and intelligence agencies to meet the threat, including of
cyber attack.
- Ensure efforts to tackle terrorism do not stigmatise or alienate
Muslims or any other ethnic or faith group, and that government
supports communities to help prevent those at risk of
radicalisation from being drawn into illegal activity.
- Review the process of assessing threats against different ethnic
and religious communities to ensure all groups in the UK are
properly protected.
- An effective approach to reducing drug harm
For too long the debate about effective ways to reduce the
harm caused by drugs has been distorted by political prejudice.
Around the world, countries are trialling new approaches that are
reducing drug harm, improving lives, reducing addiction and saving
taxpayers’ money. In the UK we have made good progress on
treatment but we continue to give 80,000 people a year a criminal
record for drug possession, blighting their employment chances,
and we still imprison 1,000 people a year for personal possession
when they are not charged with dealing or any other offence.
We will:
- Adopt the approach used in Portugal where those arrested for
possession of drugs for personal use are diverted into treatment,
education or civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record.
- As a first step towards reforming the system, legislate to end
the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal


use, diverting resources towards tackling organised drug crime
instead.
- Continue to apply severe penalties to those who manufacture,
import or deal in illegal drugs, and clamp down on those who
produce and sell unregulated chemical highs.
- Establish a review to assess the effectiveness of the cannabis
legalisation experiments in the United States and Uruguay in
relation to public health and criminal activity.
- Legislate to make the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
independent in setting the classification of drugs, while remaining
accountable to Parliament and the wider public.
- Enable doctors to prescribe cannabis for medicinal use.
- Put the Department of Health rather than the Home Office in
charge of drug policy.
- Restoring confidence in our borders
The UK secures many benefits from immigration, which boosts our
economy and helps staff our public services, especially our NHS.
But we need to tackle the weaknesses in our immigration system,
which threatened to undermine confidence in it. That is why we have
led work fully to restore border checks on entry and exit. We need
to improve the administration of our system so we deal with asylum
claims and visa applications promptly and return those who do not
have a valid claim to be in the UK. Then we can start to rebuild an
open, tolerant Britain.
We will:
- Complete the restoration of full entry and exit checks at our
borders, to rebuild confidence in immigration control, and allow
targeting of resources at those who overstay their visas.
- Speed up the processing of asylum claims, reducing the time
genuine refugees have to wait before they can settle into life in
the UK and making it easier to remove those who do not have a
right to be here. We will require working age asylum seekers who
have waited more than six months for their claim to be processed
to seek work like other benefit claimants, and only to receive
benefits if they are unable to do so. We will end the use of the
‘Azure Card’ for administering benefits in the asylum system.
- Double the number of inspections on employers to ensure all
statutory employment legislation is being respected.
- Separate students within official immigration statistics, while
taking tough action against any educational institution that allows
abuse of the student route into the UK.
- Present to Parliament an annual assessment of skill and labour


market shortfalls and surpluses and their impact on the economy,
public services and local communities, together with an audit
report on the migration control system, allowing full Parliamentary
oversight of Britain’s migration policies.
- Continue requirements for all new claimants for Jobseekers
Allowance (JSA) to have their English language skills assessed,
with JSA then being conditional on attending English language
courses for those whose English is poor.
- Encourage schools with high numbers of children with English as
a second language to host English lessons for parents.


- Power to the people
Devolution, democracy and citizenship
For freedom to be meaningful, people need the
power not just to make decisions about their
own lives, but about the way their country, their
community, their workplace and more are run.
Liberal Democrats have made a good start on
modernising and decentralising the state. But we
were thwarted in some of our attempts to reform
politics. When it came to reforming the House
of Lords and giving citizens a stronger voice
with fair votes, our proposals were blocked. We
still believe these are essential changes and will
continue our work to deliver them.


For freedom to be meaningful, people need the power not just
to make decisions about their own lives, but about the way their
country, their community, their workplace and more are run.
Liberal Democrats have made a good start on modernising and
decentralising the state. We have taken away the Prime Minister’s
power to call elections. We have improved Parliament with more
powers for backbenchers and more internal democracy. We have
devolved power to Councils and communities. We have enacted
the biggest transfer of fiscal power from Westminster to Scotland in
three hundred years. We have supported employee democracy and
the mutuals movement.
But we were thwarted in some of our attempts to reform politics.
When it came to reforming the House of Lords and giving citizens a
stronger voice with fair votes, our proposals were blocked. We still
believe these are essential changes and will continue our work to
deliver them.


- Get big money out of politics with a
£10,000 cap on donations as part
of wider funding reform
- Better democracy with a fair voting
system in local government and at
Westminster and votes at 16
- Deliver on our promises to
Scotland in full, devolve more
powers to Wales, and work for a
shared future in Northern Ireland
- Meet the needs of England with
Devolution on Demand, letting local
areas take control of the services
that matter most to them
- Passed a Lobbying Act to introduce
a register of consultant lobbyists and
curb the influence of special interest
money in elections
- Fixed term Parliaments, taking away
a Prime Minister’s power to call
elections when it suits their own party
- New powers for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, including more
financial devolution than ever before
- Devolved £7 billion of funding for
transport and economic growth to
local areas in England.
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Better politics
Unfair votes, overcentralisation of decision-making, the power of
patronage and the influence of powerful corporate lobbies mean
ordinary citizens and local communities are too often excluded and
sidelined in politics today. We need to reform British politics to make
it more representative and more empowering of our citizens so it
commands greater public confidence.
We will:
- Take big money out of politics by capping donations to political
parties at £10,000 per person each year, and introducing wider
reforms to party funding along the lines of the 2011 report of the
Committee on Standards in Public Life, funded from savings from
existing government spending on politics.
- Protect the rights of trade union members to have their


subscriptions, including political levies, deducted from their
salary, and strengthen members’ political freedoms by letting
them choose which political party they wish to support through
such automatic payments. We will encourage wider participation
in trade union ballots through electronic voting.
- Introduce votes at age 16 for elections and referendums across
the UK, and make it easier to register to vote in schools and
colleges.
- Reform the House of Lords with a proper democratic mandate,
starting from the proposals in the 2012 Bill.
- Reform our voting systems for elections to local government and
Westminster to ensure more proportional representation. We
will introduce the Single Transferable Vote for local government
elections in England and for electing MPs across the UK. We will
reduce the number of MPs but only as part of the introduction of
a reformed, fair, voting system.
- Cancel the boundary review due to report in 2018. While new
constituencies would need to be established for a new voting
system, we believe constituency boundary reviews should respect
natural geographical communities, with greater flexibility for the
Boundary Commission to deviate from exact equality to take
account of community ties and continuity of representation.
- Explore options to strengthen and simplify the voting rights
of UK citizens living abroad and address disenfranchisement
experienced by some.
- Work with the broadcasters to formalise the process for Leaders'
Debates in General Elections, helping ensure they happen and
setting a clear threshold for those eligible to participate.
- Strengthen and expand the lobbying register and prohibit MPs
from accepting paid lobbying work. We will consider carefully the
work of the independent reviewer into the impact of third party
spending regulations to ensure the right balance has been struck.
We will also remove the discrimination against third parties by
requiring political parties to include the cost of staffing in their
national expense limits in the same way as third parties now do.
To reform Parliament in particular we will:
- Strengthen the role of MPs in amending the Budget and
scrutinising government spending proposals.
- Make Parliament more family-friendly, and establish a review to
pave the way for MP jobsharing arrangements.
- Implement a House Business committee to ensure that Parliament
and not the executive decides the Parliamentary timetable, ending
the ‘talking out’ of private members’ business. Building on the
Wright Committee recommendations of 2009, and experiences


of Coalition, we will conduct a full review of Parliamentary
procedures, which should formally recognise individual political
parties not just Government and Opposition.
- A decentralised but United Kingdom
Liberal Democrats have a proud record of leading the way on giving
greater powers to the nations of the UK. Liberal Democrat Ministers
were the ones to lead the 2012 Scotland Act and the 2014 Wales
Act through Parliament, transferring more financial autonomy to
Scotland than ever before, and Wales’ first tax powers. And in the
last months, we have given the governments of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland the power to lower the voting age to 16.
Now we need go further. We must deliver on the promises
made to the people of Scotland and the rest of the UK to further
decentralise power. In short, we will deliver Home Rule to each of
the nations of a strong, federal United Kingdom.
Constitutional change has taken place rapidly. We now need to
make sure all the new arrangements work together coherently and
we will therefore establish a UK Constitutional Convention, made up
from representatives of the political parties, academia, civic society
and members of the public, tasked with producing a full written
constitution for the UK, to report within two years.
There are many powers that we think should be devolved on an
equal basis to the existing Parliaments and Assemblies. We will
transfer power to:
- Borrow for investment.
- Manage the Crown Estate’s economic assets.
- Control a range of benefits for older people, carers and disabled
people.
Scotland
After the independence referendum, the Smith Commission brought
Scotland’s five main parties together to agree what further powers
should be assigned to the Scottish Parliament. Liberal Democrats
ensured the package of powers reflects Scotland’s key priorities.
The Scottish Parliament should raise in tax more than half of
what it spends in its budget. A Scottish welfare system should allow
the Scottish Parliament to change the benefits regime where there
is specific Scottish need or priority, with a starting budget of around
£3 billion.
These powers and more will deliver for the Scottish people: an


empowered and accountable Scottish Parliament in a strong and
secure United Kingdom.
We will deliver Home Rule for Scotland by implementing the
Smith Commission proposals in full in the first session of the next
Parliament. We will continue to make the case for powers currently
held at Westminster and Holyrood to be transferred directly to local
government where appropriate.
Wales
We endorse the recent St. David’s Day announcement and will
implement it in full, devolving powers over energy, ports, local
elections, broadcasting and more, and implementing a reserved
powers model.
But this announcement does not go far enough. Liberal
Democrats will go further and deliver proper Home Rule for Wales
and a Welsh Parliament by:
- Implementing the remaining Silk Part 1 proposals on financial
powers for Wales. We will consider the work of the Government’s
review on devolution of Air Passenger Duty (APD), with a view to
devolving long-haul APD.
- Implementing the Silk Part 2 proposals by:
- Transferring powers from the UK Parliament to the National
Assembly over S4C, sewerage, transport, teachers’ pay,
youth justice, policing and in the longer term other justice
powers.
- Devolving funding of Network Rail in relation to the Wales
network.
- Strengthening the capacity of the National Assembly to
scrutinise legislation and hold the Welsh Government to
account.
- Allowing the Welsh Government to set its own bank holidays.
- Providing for a Welsh Parliament, preventing Westminster from
being able to override Wales on devolved matters, and devolving
the power to amend electoral arrangements for the Assembly and
local elections in Wales with a two thirds majority.
- Giving the Children’s Commissioner for Wales the power to
examine issues that affect children in Wales but are not within the
control of the Welsh Government.
In addition, to help create jobs and boost growth in Wales, we will
abolish the economically distorting tolls on the Severn Bridge once
the debts are paid off.


Northern Ireland
Liberal Democrats wish to see a permanently peaceful, stable,
non-sectarian and truly democratic society in Northern Ireland. We
will work constructively with the political parties in Northern Ireland
and with the Irish Government to ensure the political stability of
the Northern Ireland Assembly and other institutions of the Belfast
Agreement. To grow the economy, tackle social exclusion, overcome
inequality and deliver efficiencies in public services, Liberal
Democrats will support policies and initiatives that promote sharing
over separation and counter the cost of division. A key aspect of
this is dealing with the legacy of the past. The Stormont House
Agreement represents another stage in the intensive work necessary
to build long-term peace, stability and prosperity in Northern Ireland.
In Government we delivered on the commitment to enable the
devolution of Corporation Tax to Northern Ireland by April 2017. We
will continue to work with all parties to implement the full package
of measures in the Stormont House Agreement and address
outstanding issues. We will build on this by:
- Keeping under review the prospect of further devolution of fiscal
powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly and other powers that
would improve the financial accountability of the Assembly.
- Promoting a strong mechanism for working constructively with
civic society in Northern Ireland.
- Working to ensure the interface is smooth and effective between
national security and counter-terrorism policing on the one hand,
and local policing and criminal justice activities on the other.
- Supporting changes to the powers and internal mechanisms of
the Northern Ireland Assembly that reinforce the development
of normal, democratic principles and enhances the creation of a
shared future beyond sectarianism and division.
- Working with the political parties in Northern Ireland to tackle the
cost of division and ensuring all Government policies in Northern
Ireland support the aim of a genuine Shared Future for all.
England
Devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has
implications for the UK Parliament and its dual role in legislating for
England as well as the federal UK. It is possible that a future UK
government could use the support of MPs representing Scotland,
Wales or Northern Ireland to secure the passage of legislation
that only affects England, even if the majority in England were
opposed. This would be a key issue for our proposed Constitutional
Convention to address.
Liberal Democrats believe an English-only stage in legislation


affecting England should be considered, so English MPs can have a
separate say on laws that only affect England. However, this would
need to be on a proportional basis, genuinely reflecting the balance
of opinion in England, not the distorted picture generated by the
First Past the Post system.
Beyond Parliament, there is much to change to improve the way
communities in England are governed. By returning power to the
villages, towns, cities and regions of England we can drive growth,
improve public services and give people freedom to run their own
lives.
To rejuvenate local government in England, we will:
- Reduce the powers of Ministers to interfere in democratically
elected local government.
- Remove the requirement to hold local referenda for Council Tax
changes, ensuring Councillors are properly accountable for their
decisions by introducing fair votes.
- Build on the success of City Deals and Growth Deals to devolve
more power and resources to groups of Local Authorities and
Local Enterprise Partnerships, starting with back-to-work
support.
- Establish a Government process to deliver greater devolution
of financial responsibility to English Local Authorities, and any
new devolved bodies in England, building on the work of the
Independent Commission on Local Government Finance. Any
changes must balance the objectives of more local autonomy and
fair equalisation between communities.
In some areas of England there is an even greater appetite for
powers, but not every part of the country wants to move at the same
speed and there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. We will
therefore introduce Devolution on Demand, enabling even greater
devolution of powers from Westminster to Councils or groups of
Councils working together – for example to a Cornish Assembly.
Funding
The nations of the United Kingdom have long had different needs
with regard to funding. The Barnett Formula is the mechanism used
to adjust spending allocations across the UK.
The Liberal Democrats have already delivered a substantial
extension of financial powers to the nations of the UK and we will
devolve further fiscal powers to the devolved governments. In order
to ensure reliable funding, we will retain the Barnett Formula as the


basis for future spending allocations for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. This will protect the individual nations’ budgets from external
shocks like the recent global drop in the price of oil. We recognise
the findings of the Holtham Commission that the current formula
underfunds Wales and will commission work to update this analysis.
We will address the imbalance by immediately entrenching a Barnett
floor set at a level that reflects the need for Wales to be funded fairly,
and seek over a Parliament to increase the Welsh block grant to an
equitable level.
- Everyday democracy
To lead a fulfilled life, people need power over more than just their
government. Liberal Democrats will spread democracy in everyday life
by encouraging mutuals, cooperatives, and employee participation and
by increasing the opportunities for people to take democratic control
over the services on which they rely. We will encourage citizens to
engage in practical social action, seeing government as an enabler and
facilitator rather than just a commissioner and provider of services.
We will:
- Aim to increase the number of Neighbourhood, Community
and Parish Councils and promote tenant management in social
housing.
- Encourage employers to promote employee participation and
employee ownership, aiming to increase further the proportion of
GDP in employee-owned businesses. We will change company
law to permit a German-style two-tier board structure to include
employees.
- Introduce mandatory arbitration for strikes likely to cause
widespread public disruption, enabling us to defend workers’
rights to strike while ensuring continued service in essential public
services.
- Strengthen worker participation in decision-making, including
staff representation on remuneration committees, and the right
for employees who collectively own 5% of a company to be
represented on the board.
- Give football fans a greater say in how their clubs are run by
encouraging the reform of football governance rules to promote
engagement between clubs and supporters.
- Support local libraries and ensure any libraries under threat of
closure are offered first for transfer to the local community.
- Spread mutual structures and employee participation through the
public sector.


- Strengthen community rights to run local public services, and
protect community assets like pubs by bringing forward a
Community Right to Buy. We will ensure planning permission is
required to convert a pub into alternative uses.
- Support social investment, ensuring charities and social
enterprises can access the support and finance they need
to develop and deliver innovative, sustainable solutions to
challenges in their communities.
- Protecting the space for democratic debate
We recognise the importance of a plural and diverse media, free
from state influence or from monopolistic or dominant market
control, in guaranteeing a vibrant national conversation. We will
therefore reform the existing arrangements for safeguarding plurality
in the media broadly in line with the recommendations of the 2014
Lords Communications Select Committee report.
We will:
- Give lead responsibility to Ofcom and enable it to conduct
reviews periodically, as well as when triggered by proposed
mergers and acquisitions, and enable Ofcom to set down
conditions to prevent the reach of any media company damaging
the public interest.
- Ensure any conditions or requirements that Ofcom lays down
following a plurality review can only be vetoed or interfered with
by a Minister after a vote of both Houses of Parliament.
- Use a variety of measures to ensure that there is a vibrant local
and ‘hyperlocal’ media to help inform citizens about their local
area and their local politics, including:
- Redirecting the current subsidies for ‘local TV’, which have
failed to contribute significantly to cultural life.
- Extending Ofcom’s community radio grant support to
online hyperlocals, and allowing non-profit local media
outlets to obtain charitable status where the public interest
is being served.


- Britain in the world
Global action for security and prosperity
In a more globalised, interdependent world,
freedom for individuals is not best protected
solely by the nation state. Corporations, banks
and markets now operate across the globe
with little respect for national borders. Climate
change, one of the greatest challenges of our
age, is by its nature global. And criminals,
hackers and terrorists now operate across
borders, too. It is in the interests of all countries
to create a system of international law and
governance, both treaty-based and multilateral,
at the global level. We will ensure Britain actively
and constructively works with our allies and
partners in the European Union, Commonwealth,
UN and NATO to engage with and develop policy
responses when liberal internationalism and the
rules-based system are challenged.


Liberal Democrats are internationalists because we respect the
rights of human beings wherever they live and understand that by
working together countries can achieve more than they can alone.
This is particularly true for a country like the UK with a rich web of
global relationships, which gives it the potential to wield greater
influence than its economic or military power alone would permit.
In a more globalised, interdependent world, freedom for
individuals is not best protected solely by the nation state.
Corporations, banks and markets now operate across the globe
with little respect for national borders. Climate change, one of the
greatest challenges of our age, is by its nature global. And criminals,
hackers and terrorists now operate across borders, too. It is in the
interests of all countries to create a system of international law and
governance, both treaty-based and multilateral, at the global level.
Liberal Democrats have worked tirelessly in government to
keep Britain at the heart of the European Union, to secure the best
deal for British citizens. Our Ministers have represented the UK
across the world on vital issues from climate change to nuclear
disarmament and secured agreements that will keep us all safer,
not least the International Arms Trade Treaty. We have stood up
for human rights, the rule of international law and humanitarian
aid, delivering for the first time on the 40 year old UN ambition for
developed countries to spend 0.7% of national income as Official
Development Assistance.
We will ensure Britain actively and constructively works with our
allies and partners in the European Union, Commonwealth, UN and
NATO to engage with and develop policy responses when liberal
internationalism and the rules-based system are challenged.


- Ensure the 2015 Sustainable
Development Goals aim to end
poverty, protect the environment
and leave no one behind
- Improve tax transparency including
in low-income countries by
extending country-by-country
reporting from banks and
extractive industries to all UK listed
companies
- Ensure Britain plays a constructive
part in the European Union and any
referendum triggered by the EU Act
is on the big question: In or Out
- Work to secure a binding global
agreement on cutting emissions,
and a stronger commitment within
the EU to a 50% reduction by 2030
- Focus on ensuring our armed
forces have the training and
equipment they need for the threats
of today and end continuous
nuclear weapon patrols
- Increased aid spending to 0.7% of
national income, and guaranteed this
in law
- Secured a record £23.9 billion last
year from clamping down on tax
evasion, avoidance and fraud, and
won G8 agreement on transparency
on the real owners of businesses
- Passed a law to guarantee a
referendum before Britain passes any
more powers to the EU
- Agreed an ambitious EU target
of 40% cuts to carbon emissions
by 2030, and secured Rio+20
agreements on sustainable
development
- Supported our armed forces and
veterans, enshrining the Armed
Forces Covenant in law
A Record of Delivery 
A Promise of More

- Working for peace and security across the world
From the recent collapse of talks between Israelis and Palestinians
to Russian interference in Ukraine, this is a challenging time for
peace and security across the world. At times like these we need to
redouble our diplomatic efforts and work closely with our EU and
NATO partners to promote an active, rights-based foreign policy for
our mutual defence.
The UK has a proud record of playing a leading role in the
European Union and in international institutions like the UN, NATO
and the Commonwealth and should continue to do so, wherever
possible promoting our values of freedom and opportunity for all.


We will:
- Use all aspects of government policy – trade, aid and diplomacy
as well as military cooperation – to focus UK policy on conflict
prevention. This will require a joint approach across the MOD,
FCO, DFID and other departments, and we will continue to assess
UK government actions for their impacts on conflict prevention
and security. This will be a priority within the 2015 Strategic
Defence and Security Review (SDSR), which should begin
immediately after the election.
- Engage with and strengthen multilateral UN and treaty-based
institutions worldwide.
- Support the UN principle of Responsibility to Protect. This
principle focuses on the security of individuals, rather than states.
- Improve control of arms exports by:
- Implementing a policy of ‘presumption of denial’ for arms
exports to countries listed as countries of concern in the
Foreign Office’s annual human rights report.
- Requiring end-user certification on all future arms export
licenses with an annual report to Parliament on this
certification.
Should all these institutions and policies fail, we recognise it will be
necessary to consider military interventions to protect ourselves and
fulfil our international obligations. However in these circumstances,
Liberal Democrats believe the UK should intervene only when there
is a clear legal and/or humanitarian case, endorsed by a vote in
Parliament, working within the remit of international institutions
wherever and whenever possible.
In response to current major conflicts worldwide, we will:
- Promote democracy and stability in Ukraine and neighbouring
countries against an increasingly assertive Russia. We will work
closely with EU and other international partners to exert maximum
economic and political pressure on Russia to stop interfering in
the affairs of sovereign Eastern European nations, and will stand
by our obligations under the NATO treaty in the event of threats
to NATO member states. We will work with the EU to develop an
EU energy strategy that will reduce reliance on Russia’s energy
supplies.
- Continue to work with international partners – Western,
African and Arab – to tackle Islamic fanaticism embodied by
organisations like the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria
and Boko Haram in Nigeria. These extremist organisations pervert
Islam and carry out appalling atrocities against Muslims as well as


non-Muslims. This is a generational challenge that will take time
and patience. We favour broadening the international Coalition
against IS.
- Recognising that airstrikes alone will not defeat IS, continue a
comprehensive approach, in compliance with international law, to
supporting the Iraqi government in standing against IS, including:
- Assistance in strengthening its democratic institutions.
- Training the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga
fighters.
- Humanitarian relief to help alleviate the suffering of
displaced Syrians and Iraqis.
- Support the moderate opposition in Syria, who are fighting both
President Bashar al-Assad and IS. We will continue to push for an
inclusive political transition in Syria, which would enable Syrian
moderates from all sides to unite against extremism and tyranny.
- Remain committed to a negotiated peace settlement to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which includes a two-state solution.
We condemn disproportionate force used by all sides. We
condemn Hamas’ rocket attacks and other targeting of Israeli
civilians. We condemn Israel’s continued illegal policy of
settlement expansion, which undermines the possibility of a two-state
solution. We support recognition of the independent State
of Palestine as and when it will help the prospect of a two-state
solution.
- Support multilateral negotiations to stop Iran obtaining nuclear
weapons. We will continue to seek normalisation of our diplomatic
relations with Iran, including reopening the British Embassy in
Tehran and promoting peaceful dialogue between Iran and Saudi
Arabia.
- Our armed forces and security services
The UK must be able to defend itself and the territories for which it
has responsibility, support its neighbours and allies, and engage in
humanitarian intervention. Many of the security challenges the UK
faces are shared by our partners and allies in the EU and NATO and
the UK is more effective and more resilient when we work closely
with those partners.
Liberal Democrats are clear that the security offered by our
continued membership of the EU is more crucial than ever, as are
our bilateral relationships with our key European allies. We favour
greater integration of military capabilities and procurement to
address common problems, to overcome economic constraints and
to maintain a full spectrum of defence capabilities. To achieve this,
we will build on the treaty-based arrangements we have established


and extend this cooperation to other suitable European partners.
Liberal Democrats are committed to meeting our national and
international obligations in security and defence. This is why in
government over the last five years we met the NATO commitment
to spend 2% of our GDP on defence, most recently restated in
the Readiness Action Plan and Defence Industrial Pledge at the
Wales NATO Summit in 2014. We are committed to completing a
comprehensive Strategic Defence and Security Review early in the
next Parliament to inform future defence spending decisions. We
recognise that the world has changed fundamentally since the last
such review. It is vital that our real security and defence needs and
international obligations are considered in the SDSR, and this is why
we wish to move towards a Single Security Budget.
We will:
- Conduct a Strategic Defence and Security Review in which we
will revisit and update the Future Force 2020 vision and ensure the
capabilities we are invested in are relevant for keeping Britain safe.
- Use the SDSR to establish a Single Security Budget, including not
just conventional defence spending but the work of our security
agencies, cyber defences and soft power interventions. The Single
Security Budget will be distributed by the SDSR process, as part of
an overall Spending Review. This integrated approach will ensure
spending choices follow the capabilities we need, not traditional
departmental silos.
- Maintain strong and effective armed forces and the capability to
deploy rapidly expeditionary forces.
- Set long-term budgets to invest in the right equipment at competitive
prices.
- Recognise the expansion of warfare into the cybersphere, by
investing in our security and intelligence services and acting to
counter cyber attacks.
- Remain fully engaged in international nuclear disarmament efforts.
- Step down the nuclear ladder by procuring fewer Vanguard
successor submarines and moving from continuous at sea
deterrence to a contingency posture of regular patrols, enabling
a surge to armed patrols when the international security context
makes this appropriate. This would help us to fulfil our Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments and reduce the UK nuclear
warhead stockpile.
- Work for new global standards to end the use of conventional
explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas.
- Promote European defence integration where appropriate by
enhancing European defence industry co-operation.


Liberal Democrats recognise the vital role the UK’s armed forces
play in the defence of the nation and believe that it is the role of
government to safeguard the interests of service personnel and
veterans. We strongly support the Armed Forces Covenant, now
enshrined in law in the 2011 Armed Forces Act. We also propose:
- Transferring the Office of the Veterans’ Minister to the Cabinet
Office, so that the services of all departments can be marshalled
in support of veterans and creating a post of Veterans’
Commissioner.
- Improving support for personnel and veterans with mental health
problems, including alcohol dependency.
- Strengthening local military covenants by defining more exacting
guidelines and ensuring best practice is rolled out across all Local
Authorities.
The government in 2011 set a target for increasing the size of the
Reserves to 30,000 but it is significantly behind in achieving this
goal, with continued problems of retention. We acknowledge the
different pressures that Reserves face and propose that:
- Emphasis be put on improving retention and training of Reserves
at current levels.
- Employers be required to offer two weeks’ unpaid leave annually
to assist Reserves attending training camps.
- Britain in Europe: prosperity and reform
Britain’s membership of the EU is essential for creating a stronger
economy and for projecting influence in the world. Millions of British
jobs are linked to our trade with the EU, and being in Europe puts
us on a more equal footing when negotiating trade deals with global
players like the USA and China and in countering security threats.
A modernised EU is crucial to responding to the global challenges
Britain faces, whether they are climate change, cross-border crime
and terrorism, or conflict.
If the UK were to leave the EU, trade rules would be made
without us, our voice would not be heard in climate change
negotiations and our borders would be more vulnerable. There is no
doubt the UK would be poorer and weaker if we walked away from
our closest neighbours and most trusted allies and left the EU.
But that does not mean that the institutions and policies of
the European Union are perfect and do not need reform. Liberal
Democrats are the party of reform whether that is in Westminster,
Holyrood, the Senedd or in local Councils and the EU is no
exception.


British Exports
The European Union is the biggest export market
for British goods.


Liberal Democrats in Government have already secured
significant reforms like cutting the EU budget by £30 billion and
reforming the Common Fisheries Policy, ending the discarding
of usable fish. We have also shifted the balance of EU spending
towards jobs, growth and innovation. Only by remaining fully
engaged in the EU can we deliver the further reforms that are
urgently needed not only for the UK, but also for the rest of the EU.
We will:
- Work to deepen the EU single market in the energy sector, in the
digital economy and for services. We will boost British exports by
scrapping national barriers to British firms trading online and by
concluding ambitious EU trade agreements with key markets like
Japan and India. We will implement the recommendations made
by Michael Moore MP in October 2014, including publishing an
annual European Business White Paper and appointing an EU
Business Minister to lead this competitiveness agenda.
- Support negotiations at the World Trade Organisation as well
as an ambitious Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP) between the EU and the USA, which could bring benefits
of up to £10 billion a year to the British economy. We will only
support an agreement that upholds EU standards of consumer,
employee and environmental protection, and allows us to
determine how NHS services are provided.
- Work to reform the EU to make it more efficient, reducing the
proportion of the EU budget spent on the Common Agricultural
Policy, abolishing unnecessary EU institutions like the European
Economic and Social Committee and scrapping the second seat
of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
- Continue to reduce the burden of EU legislation on business by
curbing unnecessary red tape, exempting small businesses from
EU rules where possible and defending the UK opt-out to the
Working Time Directive.
- Increase the accountability of the EU by enhancing the role of
national Parliaments in scrutinising EU decision-making and by
giving a combined majority of national Parliaments the automatic
ability to block unwanted legislation. We will strengthen UK
scrutiny of European legislation and positions taken by British
Ministers in Europe including by proposing an explicit role for
British Parliamentary Select Committees.
- Hold an In/Out referendum when there is next any Treaty change
involving a material transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the
EU. Liberal Democrats will campaign for the UK to remain in the
European Union when that referendum comes.
- Reinforce the EU’s tools for tackling cross border crime,


strengthening the role of the European Cyber Crime Centre and
reforming the European Arrest Warrant to prevent miscarriages of
justice while ensuring swift delivery of justice.
- Cooperate with other European countries to address
environmental threats and tackle climate change by securing
agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030
and developing the EU Energy Union.
- Support EU free movement, which is hugely beneficial to
millions of British citizens living in other European countries
as well as to the British economy and the public sector, for
example the thousands of European health workers who make
a vital contribution to the running of the NHS. We will prevent
any perceived ‘right to claim’ by tightening benefit rules for EU
migrants, including reducing, and ultimately abolishing, payment
of Child Benefit to children who are not resident in the UK. We will
also lengthen transitional controls for new EU member countries,
and eliminate loopholes.
- Cooperate with other European countries to address the
pressure of migration across the Mediterranean. We will push
for more effective EU measures to prevent the tragic loss of life
for many crossing the Mediterranean, including through greater
cooperation with anti-human-trafficking operations.
- Continue to work closely with other EU governments on foreign
policy issues towards Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and North
Africa. We will build on our already close defence cooperation
with France, the Netherlands, the Nordic states and other
European countries, as the most reliable basis for British security.
- International development
In government, Liberal Democrats have led the way on international
development and aid. We have worked to end the use of rape as a
weapon of war. We have led international efforts to tackle the Ebola
crisis in Sierra Leone and, through investment in the Global Alliance
for Vaccines and Immunisations (GAVI), Britain is a global leader in
preventing communicable diseases.
Now, we need to build on progress made since the agreement
of the Millennium Development Goals and work to eliminate
absolute poverty by 2030 – through aid but also through economic
development.
We will:
- Develop a whole-government approach to development.
- Continue to promote private sector economic development,
ensuring this benefits local people and small businesses not just


multinational corporations. We will lead international action to ensure
global companies pay fair taxes in the developing countries in which
they operate, including tightening anti-tax haven rules and requiring
large companies to publish their tax payments and profits for each
country in which they operate.
- Maintain our commitment to spend 0.7% of UK Gross National
Income on overseas development, which the International
Development Act 2015, introduced by a Liberal Democrat, now
enshrines in law. We will adhere to the OECD’s definition of what
activities qualify.
- Conduct a full Bilateral and Multilateral Aid Review to ensure that the
Department for International Development continues to work in the
right places and through the right channels.
- Continue building the resilience of poorer countries to resist future
disasters, investing in healthcare and infrastructure and training
emergency response volunteers, and respond generously to
humanitarian crises wherever they may occur.
- Work to ensure the Sustainable Development Goals aim to:
- Safeguard the sustainability of the planet.
-  Leave no one behind, helping the most vulnerable as well as
improving average living standards. We will ensure people do
not suffer discrimination or disadvantage because of gender,
sexual orientation, disability or ethnic origin.
- Eliminate absolute poverty by 2030.
- Invest to eliminate within a generation preventable diseases like TB,
HIV and malaria and explore new ways to support public and private
research and development into treatment for these and other deadly
diseases and infections.


- Create a new civil society partnership scheme to build
links between peoples in rich and poor countries, including
partnerships between communities, trade unions or emergency
services.
- International action on the environment
The open and internationalist approach Liberal Democrats
have always adopted is particularly crucial when it comes to
environmental policy. Pollution does not respect national borders,
and wildlife and ecosystems are not constrained by political
boundaries. Challenges like climate change and deforestation are
too massive for individual countries to tackle alone.
We will:
- Continue pushing for a 50% reduction in EU greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030 and the greater use of EU funds to support
low-carbon investments, while ensuring the UK meets its own
climate commitments and plays a leadership role in efforts to
combat climate change.
- Work to secure agreement on a global climate treaty at the 2015
UN Climate Conference, supported by a well-financed Green
Climate Fund to assist poorer countries to tackle and adapt to
climate change.
- Work with regulatory bodies and financial investors to establish
a global reporting standard for fossil fuel companies on the
potential impact of future restrictions on carbon emissions on
their asset base.
- Provide greater resources for international environmental
cooperation, particularly on actions to tackle illegal trade in
timber, wildlife and fish.
- Argue for an EU and global target of halting net global
deforestation by 2020 – including supporting better forest law
enforcement and governance and sustainable agriculture, closing
loopholes in the EU Timber Regulation and ensuring that by 2020
only legal and sustainable timber products can be sold in the UK.
- Ensure UK and EU development aid, free trade and investment
agreements support environmental goals and sustainable
investment, including maintaining the UK’s International Climate
Fund and supporting direct bilateral programmes with developing
countries on climate change.
- Create a one million square kilometre southern Atlantic Ocean
reserve.
- Push for the creation of a marine nature reserve in the Arctic
Ocean, promote the highest possible environmental standards


for UK companies operating in the region and press for a ban on
EU-flagged vessels undertaking industrial fishing in the previously
unfished areas of the Arctic.
- Standing up for Liberal values
Liberal Democrats believe British foreign policy and international aid
should seek to advance human rights and democracy throughout
the world. We believe all people – regardless of ethnicity, disability,
age, belief, gender or sexual orientation – deserve a freer, fairer and
more prosperous world.
We will:
- Continue to support free media and a free and open Internet
around the world, championing the free flow of information.
- Maintain funding to BBC World Service, BBC Monitoring and the
British Council.
- Develop a comprehensive strategy for promoting the
decriminalisation of homosexuality around the world, and
advancing the cause of LGBT+ rights.
- Prioritise support, protection and equal rights for women and
girls, which is essential for effective, sustainable economic
development. We will pursue an International Gender Equality
Strategy, work to secure women’s rights to education and
freedom from forced marriage; and aim to end female genital
mutilation worldwide within a generation.
- Extend existing reporting rules to establish consistent
requirements on all large UK companies to report on the social,
environmental and human rights impacts of their activities and
those of their supply chains.
The recent Islamist extremist attacks on journalists in Europe are a
sharp reminder of the need to protect freedom of speech and belief
internationally. We will appoint an Ambassador-level Champion for
Freedom of Belief to drive British diplomatic efforts in this field, and
we will campaign for the abolition of blasphemy, sedition, apostasy
and criminal libel laws worldwide, having already been responsible
for ending them in this country.
